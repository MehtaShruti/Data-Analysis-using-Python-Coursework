      "I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\r\n",
      "ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and\r\n",
      "that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\r\n",
      "harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\r\n",
      "further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on\r\n",
      "the Battery.  At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning\r\n",
      "it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at\r\n",
      "the space between his legs.  He was trying his hand at a ship under\r\n",
      "full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\r\n",
      "adjoining room.  It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord\r\n",
      "said he couldn't afford it.  Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,\r\n",
      "each in a winding sheet.  We were fain to button up our monkey\r\n",
      "jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half\r\n",
      "frozen fingers.  But the fare was of the most substantial kind--not\r\n",
      "only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for\r\n",
      "supper!  One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to\r\n",
      "these dumplings in a most direful manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My boy,\" said the landlord, \"you'll have the nightmare to a dead\r\n",

      "\"Landlord,\" I whispered, \"that aint the harpooneer is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the\r\n",
      "harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.  He never eats dumplings, he\r\n",
      "don't--he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare.\"\r\n",

      "so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get\r\n",
      "into bed before I did.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not\r\n",
      "what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the\r\n",
      "evening as a looker on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently a rioting noise was heard without.  Starting up, the\r\n",
      "landlord cried, \"That's the Grampus's crew.  I seed her reported in\r\n",
      "the offing this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\r\n",
      "open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.  Enveloped in\r\n",
      "their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen\r\n",
      "comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with\r\n",
      "icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had\r\n",
      "just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they\r\n",
      "entered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the\r\n",
      "whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there\r\n",
      "officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained\r\n",
      "of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like\r\n",
      "potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for\r\n",
      "all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,\r\n",
      "or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side\r\n",
      "of an ice-island.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\r\n",
      "with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began\r\n",
      "capering about most obstreperously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\r\n",
      "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\r\n",
      "own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\r\n",
      "noise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the\r\n",
      "sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\r\n",
      "but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),\r\n",
      "I will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full\r\n",
      "six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a\r\n",
      "coffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was\r\n",
      "deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the\r\n",
      "contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some\r\n",
      "reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at\r\n",
      "once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\r\n",
      "thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\r\n",
      "Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions\r\n",
      "had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I\r\n",
      "saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few\r\n",
      "minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it\r\n",
      "seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry\r\n",
      "of \"Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of\r\n",
      "the house in pursuit of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\r\n",
      "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\r\n",
      "myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to\r\n",
      "the entrance of the seamen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal\r\n",
      "rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know how it is, but\r\n",
      "people like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes\r\n",
      "to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\r\n",
      "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\r\n",
      "indefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\r\n",
      "sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors\r\n",
      "no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To\r\n",
      "be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your\r\n",
      "own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in\r\n",
      "your own skin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\r\n",
      "thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a\r\n",
      "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be\r\n",
      "of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all\r\n",
      "over.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought\r\n",
      "to be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon\r\n",
      "me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\r\n",
      "coming?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't\r\n",
      "sleep with him.  I'll try the bench here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\r\n",
      "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots\r\n",
      "and notches.  \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's\r\n",
      "plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.\"\r\n",
      "So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief\r\n",
      "first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,\r\n",
      "the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;\r\n",
      "till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.\r\n",
      "The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for\r\n",
      "heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did\r\n",
      "not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a\r\n",
      "pine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and\r\n",
      "throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went\r\n",
      "about his business, and left me in a brown study.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\r\n",
      "short; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too\r\n",
      "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\r\n",
      "than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the\r\n",
      "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\r\n",
      "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.\r\n",
      "But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me\r\n",
      "from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at\r\n",
      "all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one\r\n",
      "from the window, and both together formed a series of small\r\n",
      "whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought\r\n",
      "to spend the night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I\r\n",
      "steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,\r\n",
      "not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad\r\n",
      "idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell\r\n",
      "but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the\r\n",
      "harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me\r\n",
      "down!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\r\n",
      "spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I\r\n",
      "began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable\r\n",
      "prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I'll wait\r\n",
      "awhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I'll have a good look at\r\n",
      "him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after\r\n",
      "all--there's no telling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and\r\n",
      "threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord! said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep\r\n",
      "such late hours?\"  It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\r\n",
      "mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.  \"No,\" he\r\n",
      "answered, \"generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to\r\n",
      "rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm.  But to-night he\r\n",

      "\"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?\"\r\n",

      "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\r\n",
      "belongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I\r\n",
      "have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\r\n",
      "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\r\n",
      "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of\r\n",
      "connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the\r\n",
      "highest degree.  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and\r\n",
      "what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe\r\n",
      "to spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so\r\n",
      "good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I\r\n",
      "take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've\r\n",
      "no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean,\r\n",

      "thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that's a purty\r\n",

      "dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed;\r\n",

      "plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty\r\n",
      "big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and\r\n",
      "little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling\r\n",
      "about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came\r\n",
      "near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come\r\n",

      "to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I\r\n",
      "was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure\r\n",
      "enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\r\n",
      "harpooneers to sleep abreast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\r\n",
      "chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there,\r\n",
      "make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\"  I turned\r\n",
      "round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of\r\n",
      "the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then\r\n",
      "glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\r\n",
      "could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude\r\n",
      "shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man\r\n",
      "striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,\r\n",
      "there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\r\n",
      "corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's\r\n",
      "wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a\r\n",
      "parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\r\n",
      "fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to\r\n",
      "the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\r\n",
      "arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare\r\n",
      "it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with\r\n",
      "little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills\r\n",
      "round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of\r\n",
      "this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could\r\n",
      "it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,\r\n",
      "and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?\r\n",
      "I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\r\n",
      "uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though\r\n",
      "this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I\r\n",
      "went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\r\n",
      "saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\r\n",
      "that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\r\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time\r\n",
      "on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\r\n",
      "stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,\r\n",
      "and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel\r\n",
      "very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the\r\n",
      "landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that\r\n",
      "night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of\r\n",
      "my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into\r\n",
      "bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\r\n",
      "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\r\n",
      "sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\r\n",
      "pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I\r\n",
      "heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\r\n",
      "come into the room from under the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\r\n",
      "head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a\r\n",
      "word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\r\n",
      "New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\r\n",
      "without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off\r\n",
      "from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at\r\n",
      "the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the\r\n",
      "room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted\r\n",
      "for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This\r\n",
      "accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a\r\n",
      "sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here\r\n",
      "and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's\r\n",
      "just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,\r\n",
      "got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at\r\n",
      "that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\r\n",
      "plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\r\n",
      "squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At\r\n",
      "first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the\r\n",
      "truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a\r\n",
      "whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by\r\n",
      "them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant\r\n",
      "voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,\r\n",
      "thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in\r\n",
      "any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly\r\n",
      "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and\r\n",
      "completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it\r\n",
      "might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never\r\n",
      "heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\r\n",
      "However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun\r\n",
      "there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while\r\n",
      "all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this\r\n",
      "harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty\r\n",
      "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently\r\n",
      "pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair\r\n",
      "on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he\r\n",
      "then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed\r\n",
      "it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver\r\n",
      "hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no\r\n",
      "hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small\r\n",
      "scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now\r\n",
      "looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger\r\n",
      "stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\r\n",
      "than ever I bolted a dinner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,\r\n",
      "but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make\r\n",
      "of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my\r\n",
      "comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely\r\n",
      "nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as\r\n",
      "much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken\r\n",
      "into my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him\r\n",
      "that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a\r\n",
      "satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last\r\n",
      "showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him\r\n",
      "were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\r\n",
      "all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\r\n",
      "Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\r\n",
      "Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green\r\n",
      "frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite\r\n",
      "plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard\r\n",
      "of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian\r\n",
      "country.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps\r\n",
      "the heads of his own brothers.  He might take a fancy to\r\n",
      "mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\r\n",
      "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\r\n",
      "that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or\r\n",
      "wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he\r\n",
      "fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little\r\n",
      "deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a\r\n",
      "three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first\r\n",
      "I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\r\n",
      "in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,\r\n",
      "and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded\r\n",
      "that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to\r\n",
      "be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing\r\n",
      "the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like\r\n",
      "a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks\r\n",
      "inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\r\n",
      "appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\r\n",
      "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes\r\n",
      "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and\r\n",
      "places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\r\n",
      "biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the\r\n",
      "shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty\r\n",
      "snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\r\n",
      "(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded\r\n",
      "in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a\r\n",
      "little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the\r\n",
      "little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\r\n",
      "never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by\r\n",
      "still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\r\n",
      "praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,\r\n",
      "during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\r\n",
      "At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\r\n",
      "unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\r\n",
      "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\r\n",
      "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\r\n",
      "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\r\n",
      "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in\r\n",
      "which I had so long been bound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\r\n",
      "one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of\r\n",
      "it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth\r\n",
      "at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next\r\n",
      "moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk\r\n",
      "between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not\r\n",
      "help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\r\n",
      "feeling me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\r\n",
      "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\r\n",
      "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But\r\n",
      "his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill\r\n",
      "comprehended my meaning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I\r\n",
      "kill-e.\"  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about\r\n",
      "me in the dark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I.  \"Landlord!\r\n",
      "Watch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again growled\r\n",
      "the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered\r\n",
      "the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on\r\n",
      "fire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the\r\n",
      "room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here\r\n",
      "wouldn't harm a hair of your head.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that\r\n",
      "that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads\r\n",
      "around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.  Queequeg, look\r\n",
      "here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Me sabbee plenty\"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\r\n",
      "sitting up in bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\r\n",
      "throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a\r\n",
      "civil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a\r\n",
      "moment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\r\n",
      "looking cannibal.  What's all this fuss I have been making about,\r\n",
      "thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has\r\n",
      "just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.\r\n",
      "Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,\r\n",
      "or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I\r\n",
      "will turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed\r\n",
      "with me.  It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\r\n",
      "motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to\r\n",
      "say--I won't touch a leg of ye.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good night, landlord,\" said I, \"you may go.\"\r\n",

      "The Counterpane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm\r\n",
      "thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had\r\n",
      "almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of\r\n",
      "patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;\r\n",
      "and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\r\n",
      "labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\r\n",
      "shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically\r\n",
      "in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various\r\n",
      "times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a\r\n",
      "strip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as\r\n",
      "the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the\r\n",
      "quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the\r\n",
      "sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was\r\n",
      "hugging me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was\r\n",
      "a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell\r\n",
      "me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\r\n",
      "settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper\r\n",
      "or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had\r\n",
      "seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\r\n",
      "somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\r\n",
      "supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\r\n",
      "packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon\r\n",
      "of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I\r\n",
      "felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went\r\n",
      "to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as\r\n",
      "possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the\r\n",
      "sheets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\r\n",
      "elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!\r\n",
      "the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;\r\n",
      "the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in\r\n",
      "the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt\r\n",
      "worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in\r\n",
      "my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\r\n",
      "myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a\r\n",
      "good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning\r\n",
      "me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the\r\n",
      "best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to\r\n",
      "my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great\r\n",
      "deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\r\n",
      "subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled\r\n",
      "nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in\r\n",
      "dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped\r\n",
      "in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\r\n",
      "frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\r\n",
      "supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the\r\n",
      "counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\r\n",
      "to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\r\n",
      "For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most\r\n",
      "awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that\r\n",
      "if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\r\n",
      "broken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from\r\n",
      "me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and\r\n",
      "for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\r\n",
      "attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often\r\n",
      "puzzle myself with it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\r\n",
      "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,\r\n",
      "to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan\r\n",
      "arm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night's events\r\n",
      "soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only\r\n",
      "alive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his\r\n",
      "arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still\r\n",
      "hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.\r\n",
      "I now strove to rouse him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a\r\n",
      "snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a\r\n",
      "horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the\r\n",
      "counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as\r\n",
      "if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;\r\n",
      "abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a\r\n",
      "tomahawk!  \"Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\"  At\r\n",
      "length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant\r\n",
      "expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male\r\n",
      "in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;\r\n",
      "and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a\r\n",
      "Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a\r\n",
      "pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\r\n",
      "altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\r\n",
      "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning\r\n",
      "over him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious\r\n",
      "misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a\r\n",
      "creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the\r\n",
      "character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to\r\n",
      "the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and\r\n",
      "sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress\r\n",
      "first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\r\n",
      "apartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,\r\n",
      "this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages\r\n",
      "have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous\r\n",
      "how essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to\r\n",
      "Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and\r\n",
      "consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him\r\n",
      "from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my\r\n",
      "curiosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man\r\n",
      "like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well\r\n",
      "worth unusual regarding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\r\n",
      "one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his\r\n",
      "boots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\r\n",
      "next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under\r\n",
      "the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I\r\n",
      "inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of\r\n",
      "propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\r\n",
      "when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature\r\n",
      "in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was\r\n",
      "just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\r\n",
      "possible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an\r\n",
      "undergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very\r\n",
      "probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,\r\n",
      "if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\r\n",
      "getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his\r\n",
      "hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began\r\n",
      "creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed\r\n",
      "to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made\r\n",
      "to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off\r\n",
      "of a bitter cold morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\r\n",
      "street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\r\n",

      "among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild\r\n",
      "gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth\r\n",
      "even beneath February's snow.  No one having previously heard his\r\n",
      "history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the\r\n",
      "utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\r\n",
      "peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\r\n",
      "he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\r\n",
      "and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran\r\n",
      "down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\r\n",
      "almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\r\n",
      "absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one\r\n",
      "removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,\r\n",
      "arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\r\n",
      "regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\r\n",
      "floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\r\n",
      "architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\r\n",
      "finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular\r\n",
      "side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.\r\n",
      "The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome\r\n",
      "pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\r\n",
      "nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole\r\n",
      "contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no\r\n",
      "means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the\r\n",
      "ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the\r\n",
      "man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\r\n",
      "sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted\r\n",
      "the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\r\n",
      "with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were\r\n",
      "of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first\r\n",
      "glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\r\n",
      "for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\r\n",
      "For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,\r\n",
      "slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up\r\n",
      "the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving\r\n",
      "him impregnable in his little Quebec.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\r\n",
      "Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\r\n",
      "sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\r\n",
      "mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober\r\n",
      "reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\r\n",
      "unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\r\n",
      "signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\r\n",
      "worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and\r\n",
      "wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is\r\n",
      "a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\r\n",
      "perennial well of water within the walls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\r\n",
      "borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.  Between the marble\r\n",
      "cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its\r\n",
      "back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship\r\n",
      "beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and\r\n",
      "snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\r\n",
      "clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\r\n",
      "forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of\r\n",
      "radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver\r\n",
      "plate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.  \"Ah,\r\n",
      "noble ship,\" the angel seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\r\n",
      "had achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in\r\n",
      "the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\r\n",

      "within.  All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into\r\n",
      "his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on\r\n",

      "thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\r\n",

      "symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well\r\n",
      "knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case\r\n",

      "shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till\r\n",

      "desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\r\n",
      "two.  His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest;\r\n",
      "and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\r\n",
      "unconquerable warriors.  There was excellent blood in his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg sought a\r\n",
      "passage to Christian lands.  But the ship, having her full complement\r\n",
      "of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father's\r\n",
      "influence could prevail.  But Queequeg vowed a vow.  Alone in his\r\n",
      "canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship\r\n",
      "must pass through when she quitted the island.  On one side was a\r\n",
      "coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove\r\n",
      "thickets that grew out into the water.  Hiding his canoe, still\r\n",
      "afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in\r\n",
      "the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like\r\n",
      "a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of his\r\n",
      "foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing\r\n",
      "himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and\r\n",
      "swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\r\n",
      "cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\r\n",
      "Queequeg budged not.  Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\r\n",
      "wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\r\n",
      "told him he might make himself at home.  But this fine young\r\n",
      "savage--this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin.\r\n",
      "They put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.  But\r\n",
      "like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities,\r\n",
      "Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily\r\n",
      "gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen.  For at\r\n",
      "bottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a profound desire to learn\r\n",
      "among the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still\r\n",
      "happier than they were; and more than that, still better than they\r\n",
      "were.  But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that\r\n",
      "even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more\r\n",
      "so, than all his father's heathens.  Arrived at last in old Sag\r\n",
      "Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to\r\n",
      "Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,\r\n",
      "poor Queequeg gave it up for lost.  Thought he, it's a wicked world\r\n",
      "in all meridians; I'll die a pagan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these\r\n",

      "Hence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and\r\n",
      "having a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and\r\n",
      "gone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts.  He answered\r\n",
      "no, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather\r\n",
      "Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled\r\n",
      "throne of thirty pagan Kings before him.  But by and by, he said, he\r\n",
      "would return,--as soon as he felt himself baptized again.  For the\r\n",
      "nonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in\r\n",
      "all four oceans.  They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed\r\n",
      "iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\r\n",
      "movements.  He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation.\r\n",
      "Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed\r\n",
      "him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most\r\n",
      "promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from.  He at\r\n",

      "dip into the Potluck of both worlds.  To all this I joyously\r\n",
      "assented; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was\r\n",
      "an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of great\r\n",

      "however, my comrade's money.  The grinning landlord, as well as the\r\n",

      "Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon\r\n",
      "barbs.  I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him\r\n",
      "ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own\r\n",
      "harpoons.  To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I\r\n",
      "hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own\r\n",
      "harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal\r\n",

      "own harpoon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story\r\n",

      "The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry\r\n",
      "his heavy chest to his boarding house.  Not to seem ignorant about\r\n",

      "Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant\r\n",
      "water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a\r\n",

      "honour, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the\r\n",
      "High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg's father.  Grace being\r\n",
      "said,--for those people have their grace as well as we--though\r\n",

      "upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say, being said,\r\n",

      "into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates.  Seeing himself\r\n",
      "placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking\r\n",

      "At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the\r\n",
      "schooner.  Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river.  On one\r\n",
      "side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered\r\n",
      "trees all glittering in the clear, cold air.  Huge hills and\r\n",
      "mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by\r\n",
      "side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at\r\n",
      "last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with\r\n",
      "blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening\r\n",
      "that new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long\r\n",
      "voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a\r\n",
      "third, and so on, for ever and for aye.  Such is the endlessness,\r\n",

      "turnpike earth!--that common highway all over dented with the marks\r\n",
      "of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity\r\n",
      "of the sea which will permit no records.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\r\n",
      "His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed\r\n",
      "teeth.  On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to\r\n",
      "the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.\r\n",
      "Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a\r\n",
      "wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land\r\n",
      "tornadoes.  So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the\r\n",
      "plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering\r\n",
      "glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that\r\n",
      "two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man\r\n",
      "were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.  But there\r\n",
      "were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense\r\n",
      "greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure.\r\n",
      "Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his\r\n",
      "back.  I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come.  Dropping his\r\n",
      "harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost\r\n",
      "miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the\r\n",
      "air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow\r\n",
      "landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his\r\n",
      "back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a\r\n",
      "puff.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Hallo, YOU sir,\" cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking\r\n",
      "up to Queequeg, \"what in thunder do you mean by that?  Don't you know\r\n",
      "you might have killed that chap?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What him say?\" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He say,\" said I, \"that you came near kill-e that man there,\"\r\n",
      "pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Kill-e,\" cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an\r\n",
      "unearthly expression of disdain, \"ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;\r\n",
      "Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain\r\n",
      "to mind his own eye.  The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had\r\n",
      "parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from\r\n",
      "side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.\r\n",
      "The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept\r\n",
      "overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the\r\n",
      "boom to stay it, seemed madness.  It flew from right to left, and\r\n",
      "back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant\r\n",
      "seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,\r\n",
      "and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed\r\n",
      "towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower\r\n",
      "jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,\r\n",
      "Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of\r\n",
      "the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,\r\n",
      "and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as\r\n",
      "it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way\r\n",
      "trapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and\r\n",
      "while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped\r\n",
      "to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.\r\n",
      "For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing\r\n",
      "his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his\r\n",
      "brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand\r\n",
      "and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had\r\n",
      "gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,\r\n",
      "Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see\r\n",
      "just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes\r\n",
      "more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the\r\n",
      "other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The\r\n",
      "poor bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;\r\n",
      "the captain begged his pardon.  From that hour I clove to Queequeg\r\n",
      "like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Was there ever such unconsciousness?  He did not seem to think that\r\n",
      "he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.\r\n",
      "He only asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine\r\n",
      "off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning\r\n",
      "against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to\r\n",
      "be saying to himself--\"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all\r\n",

      "overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\r\n",

      "unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or\r\n",

      "\"Not much,\" I replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon\r\n",

      "his willingness to ship me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added--\"come\r\n",

      "cabin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\r\n",
      "surprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along\r\n",
      "with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the\r\n",
      "other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by\r\n",
      "a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery\r\n",
      "wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of\r\n",
      "plank, or a nail or two in the ship.  People in Nantucket invest\r\n",
      "their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in\r\n",
      "approved state stocks bringing in good interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\r\n",
      "Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and\r\n",
      "to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure\r\n",
      "the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously\r\n",
      "modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.  For some of\r\n",
      "these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and\r\n",
      "whale-hunters.  They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a\r\n",
      "vengeance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of\r\n",
      "the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\r\n",
      "adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\r\n",
      "unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\r\n",
      "unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And\r\n",
      "when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,\r\n",
      "with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the\r\n",
      "stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest\r\n",
      "waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been\r\n",
      "led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all\r\n",
      "nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin\r\n",
      "voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some\r\n",
      "help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty\r\n",
      "language--that man makes one in a whole nation's census--a mighty\r\n",
      "pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all\r\n",
      "detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other\r\n",
      "circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness\r\n",
      "at the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically great are made\r\n",
      "so through a certain morbidness.  Be sure of this, O young ambition,\r\n",
      "all mortal greatness is but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do\r\n",
      "with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if\r\n",
      "indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the\r\n",
      "Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired\r\n",
      "whaleman.  But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what\r\n",
      "are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious\r\n",
      "things the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been\r\n",
      "originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket\r\n",
      "Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many\r\n",
      "unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not\r\n",
      "moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as\r\n",
      "altered one angle of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness,\r\n",
      "was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain\r\n",
      "Peleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms\r\n",
      "against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the\r\n",
      "Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet\r\n",
      "had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\r\n",
      "leviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,\r\n",
      "the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\r\n",
      "not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\r\n",
      "he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a\r\n",
      "man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\r\n",
      "This world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short\r\n",
      "clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied\r\n",
      "waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,\r\n",
      "and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\r\n",
      "his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the\r\n",
      "goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet\r\n",
      "receiving of his well-earned income.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\r\n",
      "incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\r\n",
      "task-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\r\n",
      "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his\r\n",
      "crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the\r\n",
      "hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially\r\n",
      "for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the\r\n",
      "least.  He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but\r\n",
      "somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work\r\n",
      "out of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured\r\n",
      "eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till\r\n",
      "you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to\r\n",
      "work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and\r\n",
      "idleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact\r\n",
      "embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he\r\n",
      "carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\r\n",
      "economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\r\n",
      "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the\r\n",
      "decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always\r\n",
      "sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His\r\n",
      "broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his\r\n",
      "drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he\r\n",
      "seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have\r\n",
      "been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\r\n",
      "certain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\r\n",
      "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\r\n",
      "and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\r\n",
      "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as\r\n",
      "Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I\r\n",
      "said nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a\r\n",
      "chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink\r\n",
      "before him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think\r\n",
      "it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be\r\n",
      "willing to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the\r\n",
      "whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the\r\n",
      "captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that\r\n",
      "these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining\r\n",
      "to the respective duties of the ship's company.  I was also aware\r\n",
      "that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very\r\n",
      "large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a\r\n",
      "ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I\r\n",
      "had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the\r\n",
      "275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that\r\n",
      "might eventually amount to.  And though the 275th lay was what they\r\n",
      "call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had\r\n",
      "a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear\r\n",
      "out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which\r\n",
      "I would not have to pay one stiver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\r\n",
      "fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.  But I am one of\r\n",
      "those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite\r\n",
      "content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am\r\n",
      "putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole, I\r\n",
      "thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not\r\n",
      "have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was\r\n",
      "of a broad-shouldered make.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\r\n",
      "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had\r\n",
      "heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony\r\n",
      "Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,\r\n",
      "therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,\r\n",
      "left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.\r\n",
      "And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty\r\n",
      "deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on\r\n",
      "board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his\r\n",
      "Bible as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying\r\n",
      "to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small\r\n",
      "surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these\r\n",
      "proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself\r\n",
      "out of his book, \"LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,\r\n",
      "where moth--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d'ye say, what lay\r\n",
      "shall we give this young man?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\r\n",
      "seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust\r\n",
      "do corrupt, but LAY--'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\r\n",
      "seventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for\r\n",
      "one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do\r\n",
      "corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though\r\n",
      "from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a\r\n",
      "landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven\r\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you\r\n",
      "come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven\r\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less\r\n",
      "than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought\r\n",
      "at the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\r\n",
      "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without\r\n",
      "lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure\r\n",
      "is, there will your heart be also.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do\r\n",
      "ye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\r\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider\r\n",
      "the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and\r\n",
      "orphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the\r\n",
      "labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those\r\n",
      "widows and those orphans.  The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,\r\n",
      "Captain Peleg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\r\n",
      "cabin.  \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in\r\n",
      "these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that\r\n",
      "would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed\r\n",
      "round Cape Horn.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing\r\n",
      "ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art\r\n",
      "still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\r\n",
      "conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee\r\n",
      "foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "so; yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him\r\n",
      "rest; he'll get up sooner or later, no doubt.  It can't last for\r\n",

      "him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but\r\n",
      "his ordinary round jacket on.  For some time, do all I would, I could\r\n",
      "not get into the faintest doze.  I had blown out the candle; and the\r\n",
      "mere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that\r\n",
      "uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me\r\n",

      "Ramadan!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break\r\n",
      "of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as\r\n",
      "if he had been screwed down to the floor.  But as soon as the first\r\n",
      "glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating\r\n",
      "joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;\r\n",
      "pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was\r\n",
      "over.\r\n",

      "uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that\r\n",
      "individual aside and argue the point with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And just so I now did with Queequeg.  \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"get into\r\n",

      "the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to\r\n",
      "the various religions of the present time, during which time I\r\n",
      "labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and\r\n",
      "prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark\r\n",
      "nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in\r\n",
      "short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense.  I told him,\r\n",
      "too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and\r\n",
      "sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now\r\n",
      "so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides,\r\n",
      "argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;\r\n",
      "and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.\r\n",
      "This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such\r\n",
      "melancholy notions about their hereafters.  In one word, Queequeg,\r\n",
      "said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an\r\n",
      "undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the\r\n",
      "hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\r\n",
      "in.  He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.  It was after a\r\n",
      "great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great\r\n",
      "battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two\r\n",
      "o'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew\r\n",
      "the inferences without his further hinting them.  I had seen a sailor\r\n",
      "who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the\r\n",
      "custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all\r\n",
      "the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,\r\n",
      "they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like\r\n",
      "a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in\r\n",
      "their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all\r\n",
      "his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas\r\n",
      "turkeys.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\r\n",
      "impression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place, he somehow\r\n",
      "seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\r\n",
      "from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\r\n",
      "than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\r\n",
      "finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\r\n",
      "religion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending\r\n",
      "concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that\r\n",
      "such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical\r\n",
      "pagan piety.\r\n",

      "passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.  Meanwhile, upon\r\n",
      "questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand\r\n",
      "that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all\r\n",
      "sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the\r\n",
      "custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to\r\n",
      "furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up\r\n",
      "eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and\r\n",
      "alcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much\r\n",
      "better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into\r\n",
      "walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and\r\n",

      "it began to tell upon him.  He breathed with a sort of muffledness;\r\n",

      "the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more\r\n",
      "perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.  \"I will have no man in my\r\n",

      "which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been\r\n",
      "extreme.  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so\r\n",
      "organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he\r\n",
      "had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently\r\n",
      "engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,\r\n",
      "would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.\r\n",

      "the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary\r\n",

      "there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\r\n",
      "plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\r\n",
      "holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\r\n",
      "beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of\r\n",
      "firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the\r\n",
      "fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he\r\n",
      "spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their\r\n",

      "dignity of some mighty woe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his\r\n",

      "either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he\r\n",
      "had; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;\r\n",
      "indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less\r\n",
      "a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the\r\n",
      "dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,\r\n",
      "by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the\r\n",
      "air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at\r\n",
      "last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But\r\n",
      "the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\r\n",

      "it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his\r\n",
      "System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate\r\n",
      "the whales from the fish.\"  But of my own knowledge, I know that down\r\n",
      "to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against\r\n",
      "Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of\r\n",
      "the same seas with the Leviathan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales\r\n",
      "from the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm\r\n",
      "bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow\r\n",
      "ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex\r\n",
      "lege naturae jure meritoque.\"  I submitted all this to my friends\r\n",
      "Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine\r\n",
      "in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons\r\n",
      "set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted\r\n",
      "they were humbug.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\r\n",
      "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\r\n",
      "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\r\n",
      "respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has\r\n",
      "given you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm\r\n",
      "blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\r\n",
      "conspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,\r\n",
      "a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have\r\n",
      "him.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\r\n",
      "meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not\r\n",
      "a fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the\r\n",
      "definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost\r\n",
      "any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have\r\n",
      "not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among\r\n",
      "spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably\r\n",
      "assumes a horizontal position.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\r\n",
      "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\r\n",
      "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\r\n",
      "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\r\n",

      "Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a\r\n",
      "place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,\r\n",
      "arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a\r\n",
      "class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced\r\n",
      "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\r\n",
      "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\r\n",
      "the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\r\n",
      "officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means\r\n",
      "Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief\r\n",
      "Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was restricted to\r\n",
      "the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the\r\n",
      "whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or\r\n",
      "Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,\r\n",
      "under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is\r\n",
      "still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present\r\n",
      "he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the\r\n",
      "captain's more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good\r\n",
      "conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely\r\n",
      "depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an\r\n",
      "important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night\r\n",
      "watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also\r\n",
      "his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he\r\n",
      "should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in\r\n",
      "some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always,\r\n",
      "by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\r\n",
      "this--the first lives aft, the last forward.  Hence, in whale-ships\r\n",
      "and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the\r\n",
      "captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers\r\n",
      "are lodged in the after part of the ship.  That is to say, they take\r\n",
      "their meals in the captain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly\r\n",

      "of it, and the community of interest prevailing among a company, all\r\n",
      "of whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages,\r\n",

      "all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck\r\n",
      "are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.  Indeed,\r\n",
      "many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper\r\n",
      "parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in\r\n",

      "he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least\r\n",
      "given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only\r\n",
      "homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though\r\n",
      "he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping\r\n",
      "upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to\r\n",
      "peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be\r\n",
      "detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of\r\n",
      "condescension or IN TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was\r\n",
      "by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind\r\n",
      "those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;\r\n",
      "incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than\r\n",
      "they were legitimately intended to subserve.  That certain sultanism\r\n",
      "of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained\r\n",
      "unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became\r\n",
      "incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.  For be a man's\r\n",

      "some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves,\r\n",
      "more or less paltry and base.  This it is, that for ever keeps God's\r\n",
      "true princes of the Empire from the world's hustings; and leaves the\r\n",
      "highest honours that this air can give, to those men who become famous\r\n",
      "more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful\r\n",
      "of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over\r\n",
      "the dead level of the mass.  Such large virtue lurks in these small\r\n",

      "royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency.\r\n",
      "But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of\r\n",
      "geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian\r\n",

      "inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not\r\n",

      "he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice,\r\n",
      "saying, \"Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,\" disappears into the cabin.\r\n",

      "When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck,\r\n",

      "Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the\r\n",
      "planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some\r\n",
      "touch of pleasantness, \"Dinner, Mr. Stubb,\" and descends the scuttle.\r\n",
      "The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly\r\n",
      "shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with\r\n",
      "that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a\r\n",
      "rapid \"Dinner, Mr. Flask,\" follows after his predecessors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\r\n",
      "seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\r\n",
      "sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off\r\n",
      "his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe\r\n",
      "right over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight,\r\n",
      "pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down\r\n",
      "rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck,\r\n",
      "reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.\r\n",
      "But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new\r\n",
      "face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\r\n",

      "to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head\r\n",
      "of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.  Wherefore\r\n",
      "this difference?  A problem?  Perhaps not.  To have been Belshazzar,\r\n",
      "King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but\r\n",
      "courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane\r\n",

      "presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that\r\n",
      "man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the\r\n",

      "consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master,\r\n",
      "then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of\r\n",
      "sea-life just mentioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned\r\n",
      "sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but\r\n",
      "still deferential cubs.  In his own proper turn, each officer waited\r\n",
      "to be served.  They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in\r\n",
      "Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.  With\r\n",
      "one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as\r\n",
      "he carved the chief dish before him.  I do not suppose that for the\r\n",
      "world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest\r\n",
      "observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.  No!  And\r\n",
      "when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef\r\n",
      "was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the\r\n",
      "mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;\r\n",
      "and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the\r\n",
      "plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\r\n",
      "circumspection.  For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where\r\n",
      "the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial\r\n",
      "Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in\r\n",
      "awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;\r\n",
      "only he himself was dumb.  What a relief it was to choking Stubb,\r\n",
      "when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.  And poor little\r\n",
      "Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family\r\n",
      "party.  His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\r\n",
      "been the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,\r\n",
      "this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\r\n",
      "degree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more\r\n",
      "would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\r\n",
      "nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask\r\n",
      "helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed\r\n",
      "it.  Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.\r\n",
      "Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on\r\n",
      "account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he\r\n",
      "deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter\r\n",
      "was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however\r\n",
      "it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing.  Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and\r\n",
      "Flask is the first man up.  Consider!  For hereby Flask's dinner was\r\n",
      "badly jammed in point of time.  Starbuck and Stubb both had the start\r\n",
      "of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear.\r\n",
      "If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have\r\n",
      "but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his\r\n",
      "repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\r\n",
      "three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\r\n",
      "precede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\r\n",
      "in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an\r\n",
      "officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\r\n",
      "otherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much\r\n",
      "relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.  Peace and\r\n",
      "satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach.\r\n",
      "I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned\r\n",
      "beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast.\r\n",
      "There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:\r\n",
      "there's the insanity of life!  Besides, if it were so that any mere\r\n",
      "sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official\r\n",
      "capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\r\n",
      "vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\r\n",
      "through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\r\n",
      "awful Ahab.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first\r\n",
      "table in the Pequod's cabin.  After their departure, taking place in\r\n",
      "inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or\r\n",
      "rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.  And\r\n",
      "then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its\r\n",
      "residuary legatees.  They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of\r\n",
      "the high and mighty cabin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\r\n",
      "invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire\r\n",
      "care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those\r\n",
      "inferior fellows the harpooneers.  While their masters, the mates,\r\n",
      "seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the\r\n",
      "harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a\r\n",
      "report to it.  They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like\r\n",
      "Indian ships all day loading with spices.  Such portentous appetites\r\n",
      "had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the\r\n",
      "previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a\r\n",
      "great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.\r\n",
      "And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble\r\n",
      "hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\r\n",
      "accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise.  And\r\n",
      "once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory\r\n",
      "by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\r\n",
      "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\r\n",
      "circle preliminary to scalping him.  He was naturally a very nervous,\r\n",
      "shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the\r\n",
      "progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.  And what with the\r\n",
      "standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\r\n",
      "tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life\r\n",
      "was one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers\r\n",
      "furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their\r\n",
      "clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at\r\n",
      "them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\r\n",
      "his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\r\n",
      "the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to\r\n",
      "the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the\r\n",
      "low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes\r\n",
      "passenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was\r\n",
      "wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible\r\n",
      "that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the\r\n",
      "vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.\r\n",
      "But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the\r\n",
      "abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in\r\n",
      "the sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants\r\n",
      "made or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of\r\n",
      "the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the\r\n",
      "trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth\r\n",
      "lurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing\r\n",
      "out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the\r\n",
      "simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round\r\n",
      "him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the\r\n",
      "whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\r\n",
      "lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\r\n",
      "would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not\r\n",
      "at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy.  How could he forget that\r\n",
      "in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\r\n",
      "guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!\r\n",
      "hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin\r\n",
      "should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to\r\n",
      "his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;\r\n",
      "to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones\r\n",
      "jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\r\n",
      "there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\r\n",
      "scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before\r\n",
      "sleeping-time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar\r\n",
      "quarters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\r\n",
      "captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights\r\n",
      "the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone\r\n",
      "that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there.  So that, in real\r\n",
      "truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be\r\n",
      "said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.  For when they did\r\n",
      "enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning\r\n",
      "inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a\r\n",
      "permanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much\r\n",

      "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\r\n",
      "simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she\r\n",
      "may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her\r\n",
      "proper cruising ground.  And if, after a three, four, or five years'\r\n",
      "voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an\r\n",

      "very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\r\n",
      "here.  I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the\r\n",
      "old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to\r\n",
      "them.  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must\r\n",
      "doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest\r\n",
      "mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was\r\n",
      "put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have\r\n",
      "gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we\r\n",
      "cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And\r\n",
      "that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an\r\n",
      "assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that\r\n",
      "the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory\r\n",
      "singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four\r\n",
      "sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of\r\n",
      "their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and\r\n",
      "sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing\r\n",
      "out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.  In Saint Stylites,\r\n",
      "the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone\r\n",
      "pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life\r\n",
      "on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in\r\n",
      "him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\r\n",
      "stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by\r\n",
      "fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything\r\n",
      "out to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern\r\n",
      "standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\r\n",
      "and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\r\n",
      "are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\r\n",
      "discovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon; who, upon the top\r\n",
      "of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred\r\n",
      "and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\r\n",
      "whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great\r\n",
      "Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\r\n",
      "Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that\r\n",
      "point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.  Admiral\r\n",
      "Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\r\n",
      "Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\r\n",
      "token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\r\n",
      "smoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\r\n",
      "Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked\r\n",
      "to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they\r\n",

      "through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what\r\n",
      "rocks must be shunned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\r\n",
      "standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\r\n",
      "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\r\n",
      "historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells\r\n",
      "us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were\r\n",
      "regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island\r\n",
      "erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs\r\n",
      "ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in\r\n",
      "a hen-house.  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay\r\n",
      "whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to\r\n",
      "the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now\r\n",
      "become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a\r\n",
      "whale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept manned from\r\n",
      "sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the\r\n",
      "helm), and relieving each other every two hours.  In the serene\r\n",
      "weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay,\r\n",
      "to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a\r\n",
      "hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if\r\n",
      "the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your\r\n",
      "legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships\r\n",
      "once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.\r\n",

      "part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests\r\n",
      "you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling\r\n",
      "accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary\r\n",
      "excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\r\n",
      "securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of\r\n",
      "what you shall have for dinner--for all your meals for three years\r\n",

      "to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a\r\n",
      "portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly\r\n",
      "destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or\r\n",

      "parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant\r\n",
      "cross-trees.  Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about\r\n",
      "as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns.  To be sure, in cold\r\n",
      "weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a\r\n",
      "watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more\r\n",
      "of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of\r\n",
      "its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even\r\n",
      "move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an\r\n",
      "ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat\r\n",
      "is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional\r\n",
      "skin encasing you.  You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in\r\n",

      "or pulpits, called CROW'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a\r\n",

      "is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas,\r\n",
      "comforters, and coats.  In front is a leather rack, in which to keep\r\n",
      "your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical\r\n",
      "conveniences.  When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in\r\n",
      "this crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with\r\n",
      "him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot,\r\n",
      "for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea\r\n",

      "them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot\r\n",
      "down upon them is a very different thing.  Now, it was plainly a\r\n",

      "men.  D'ye see it?  Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\r\n",
      "slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\r\n",
      "to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile\r\n",
      "lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\r\n",
      "inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of\r\n",
      "his vitality in him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the\r\n",

      "with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Aye, aye!\" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\r\n",
      "excited old man: \"A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for\r\n",
      "Moby Dick!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"God bless ye,\" he seemed to half sob and half shout.  \"God bless ye,\r\n",

      "him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given\r\n",
      "battle to him, was small indeed.  For, owing to the large number of\r\n",
      "whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the\r\n",
      "entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their\r\n",
      "quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole\r\n",
      "twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling\r\n",
      "sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the\r\n",
      "irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other\r\n",
      "circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread\r\n",
      "through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special\r\n",
      "individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick.  It was hardly to be\r\n",
      "doubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such\r\n",
      "or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of\r\n",
      "uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great\r\n",
      "mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to some\r\n",
      "minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in\r\n",
      "question must have been no other than Moby Dick.  Yet as of late the\r\n",
      "Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent\r\n",
      "instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster\r\n",
      "attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly\r\n",
      "gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part,\r\n",
      "were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it\r\n",
      "were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the\r\n",
      "individual cause.  In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter\r\n",
      "between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by\r\n",
      "chance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had\r\n",
      "every one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him,\r\n",
      "as for any other whale of that species.  But at length, such\r\n",
      "calamities did ensue in these assaults--not restricted to sprained\r\n",
      "wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations--but fatal\r\n",
      "to the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses,\r\n",
      "all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those\r\n",
      "things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to\r\n",
      "whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the\r\n",
      "more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters.  For not\r\n",
      "only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all\r\n",
      "surprising terrible events,--as the smitten tree gives birth to its\r\n",
      "fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma,\r\n",
      "wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them\r\n",
      "to cling to.  And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so\r\n",
      "the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the\r\n",
      "wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate\r\n",
      "there.  For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that\r\n",
      "ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all\r\n",
      "sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact\r\n",
      "with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face\r\n",
      "they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle\r\n",
      "to them.  Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed a\r\n",
      "thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to\r\n",
      "any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of\r\n",
      "the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a\r\n",
      "calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending\r\n",
      "to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit\r\n",
      "over the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale\r\n",
      "did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid\r\n",
      "hints, and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies,\r\n",
      "which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from\r\n",
      "anything that visibly appears.  So that in many cases such a panic\r\n",
      "did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had\r\n",
      "heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to\r\n",
      "encounter the perils of his jaw.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there were still other and more vital practical influences at\r\n",
      "work.  Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the\r\n",
      "Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\r\n",
      "leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body.  There\r\n",
      "are those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous\r\n",
      "enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would\r\n",
      "perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\r\n",
      "timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there\r\n",
      "are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\r\n",
      "sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered\r\n",
      "the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is\r\n",
      "restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;\r\n",
      "seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish\r\n",
      "fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern\r\n",
      "whaling.  Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm\r\n",
      "Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those\r\n",
      "prows which stem him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\r\n",
      "times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\r\n",
      "naturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only\r\n",
      "to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to\r\n",
      "be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human\r\n",
      "blood.  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or\r\n",
      "almost similar impressions effaced.  For in his Natural History, the\r\n",
      "Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish\r\n",
      "(sharks included) are \"struck with the most lively terrors,\" and\r\n",
      "\"often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against\r\n",
      "the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death.\"  And\r\n",
      "however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports\r\n",
      "as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty\r\n",
      "item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some\r\n",
      "vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few\r\n",
      "of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier\r\n",
      "days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to\r\n",
      "induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this\r\n",
      "new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other\r\n",
      "leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance\r\n",
      "at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.\r\n",
      "That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\r\n",
      "eternity.  On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may\r\n",
      "be consulted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\r\n",
      "were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number\r\n",
      "who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\r\n",
      "specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\r\n",
      "accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle\r\n",
      "if offered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be\r\n",
      "linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously\r\n",
      "inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;\r\n",
      "that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one\r\n",
      "and the same instant of time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\r\n",
      "altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability.  For\r\n",
      "as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been\r\n",
      "divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of\r\n",
      "the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,\r\n",
      "unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated\r\n",
      "the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,\r\n",
      "especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a\r\n",
      "great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the\r\n",
      "most widely distant points.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,\r\n",
      "and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by\r\n",
      "Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the\r\n",
      "Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted\r\n",
      "in the Greenland seas.  Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of\r\n",
      "these instances it has been declared that the interval of time\r\n",
      "between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.\r\n",
      "Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the\r\n",
      "Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to\r\n",
      "the whale.  So that here, in the real living experience of living\r\n",
      "men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello\r\n",
      "mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in\r\n",
      "which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still\r\n",
      "more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose\r\n",
      "waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an\r\n",
      "underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully\r\n",
      "equalled by the realities of the whalemen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\r\n",
      "knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\r\n",
      "escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some\r\n",
      "whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring\r\n",
      "Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but\r\n",
      "ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in\r\n",
      "his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should\r\n",
      "ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a\r\n",
      "ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of\r\n",
      "leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough\r\n",
      "in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to\r\n",
      "strike the imagination with unwonted power.  For, it was not so much\r\n",
      "his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm\r\n",
      "whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white\r\n",
      "wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.  These were\r\n",
      "his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,\r\n",
      "uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to\r\n",
      "those who knew him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with\r\n",
      "the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his\r\n",
      "distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally\r\n",
      "justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through\r\n",
      "a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all\r\n",
      "spangled with golden gleamings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet\r\n",
      "his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural\r\n",
      "terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\r\n",
      "specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his\r\n",
      "assaults.  More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of\r\n",
      "dismay than perhaps aught else.  For, when swimming before his\r\n",
      "exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had\r\n",
      "several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down\r\n",
      "upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back\r\n",
      "in consternation to their ship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Already several fatalities had attended his chase.  But though\r\n",
      "similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means\r\n",
      "unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White\r\n",
      "Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or\r\n",
      "death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been\r\n",
      "inflicted by an unintelligent agent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds\r\n",
      "of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of\r\n",
      "chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out\r\n",
      "of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene,\r\n",
      "exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in\r\n",
      "the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow,\r\n",
      "had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly\r\n",
      "seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the\r\n",
      "whale.  That captain was Ahab.  And then it was, that suddenly\r\n",
      "sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had\r\n",
      "reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.  No\r\n",
      "turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with\r\n",
      "more seeming malice.  Small reason was there to doubt, then, that\r\n",
      "ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild\r\n",
      "vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his\r\n",
      "frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all\r\n",
      "his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual\r\n",
      "exasperations.  The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac\r\n",
      "incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel\r\n",
      "eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and\r\n",
      "half a lung.  That intangible malignity which has been from the\r\n",
      "beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe\r\n",
      "one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east\r\n",
      "reverenced in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship\r\n",
      "it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred\r\n",
      "white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.  All that\r\n",
      "most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all\r\n",
      "truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\r\n",
      "brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to\r\n",
      "crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable\r\n",
      "in Moby Dick.  He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all\r\n",
      "the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and\r\n",
      "then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's\r\n",
      "shell upon it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise\r\n",
      "at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment.  Then, in darting at\r\n",
      "the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden,\r\n",
      "passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that\r\n",
      "tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but\r\n",
      "nothing more.  Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards\r\n",
      "home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay\r\n",
      "stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that\r\n",
      "dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and\r\n",
      "gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad.\r\n",
      "That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter,\r\n",
      "that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the\r\n",
      "fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;\r\n",
      "and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in\r\n",
      "his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium,\r\n",
      "that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he\r\n",
      "sailed, raving in his hammock.  In a strait-jacket, he swung to the\r\n",
      "mad rockings of the gales.  And, when running into more sufferable\r\n",
      "latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the\r\n",
      "tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium\r\n",
      "seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth\r\n",
      "from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he\r\n",
      "bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm\r\n",
      "orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was\r\n",
      "now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on.  Human\r\n",
      "madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.  When you\r\n",
      "think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still\r\n",
      "subtler form.  Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\r\n",
      "contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\r\n",
      "narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge.  But, as in\r\n",
      "his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's broad madness had\r\n",
      "been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great\r\n",
      "natural intellect had perished.  That before living agent, now became\r\n",
      "the living instrument.  If such a furious trope may stand, his\r\n",
      "special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned\r\n",
      "all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from\r\n",
      "having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a\r\n",
      "thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear\r\n",
      "upon any one reasonable object.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains\r\n",
      "unhinted.  But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is\r\n",
      "profound.  Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked\r\n",
      "Hotel de Cluny where we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now\r\n",
      "quit it;--and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast\r\n",
      "Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of\r\n",
      "man's upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits\r\n",
      "in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned\r\n",
      "on torsoes!  So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that\r\n",
      "captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his\r\n",
      "frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages.  Wind ye down there, ye\r\n",
      "prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king!  A family\r\n",
      "likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from\r\n",
      "your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my\r\n",
      "means are sane, my motive and my object mad.  Yet without power to\r\n",
      "kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind\r\n",
      "he did long dissemble; in some sort, did still.  But that thing of\r\n",
      "his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his\r\n",
      "will determinate.  Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that\r\n",
      "dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no\r\n",
      "Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and\r\n",
      "that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\r\n",
      "ascribed to a kindred cause.  And so too, all the added moodiness\r\n",
      "which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on\r\n",
      "the present voyage, sat brooding on his brow.  Nor is it so very\r\n",
      "unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling\r\n",
      "voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of\r\n",
      "that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those\r\n",
      "very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a\r\n",

      "Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By that circular, it\r\n",
      "appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\r\n",
      "portions of it are presented in the circular.  \"This chart divides\r\n",
      "the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees\r\n",
      "of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are\r\n",
      "twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\r\n",

      "Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,\r\n",

      "called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such\r\n",
      "undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any\r\n",
      "chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these\r\n",
      "cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\r\n",
      "surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\r\n",
      "confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary\r\n",
      "VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces\r\n",
      "some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to\r\n",
      "expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the\r\n",
      "whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic\r\n",
      "zone.  The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and\r\n",
      "along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked\r\n",
      "for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\r\n",
      "feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in\r\n",
      "crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,\r\n",

      "be wholly without prospect of a meeting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\r\n",
      "delirious but still methodical scheme.  But not so in the reality,\r\n",
      "perhaps.  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular\r\n",
      "seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude\r\n",
      "that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude\r\n",
      "this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those\r\n",
      "that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar\r\n",
      "and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved\r\n",
      "true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,\r\n",
      "applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm\r\n",
      "whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for\r\n",
      "example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,\r\n",
      "or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that\r\n",
      "were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\r\n",
      "corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,\r\n",
      "too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed\r\n",
      "himself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and\r\n",
      "ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And\r\n",
      "where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been\r\n",
      "spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,\r\n",
      "antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or\r\n",
      "place were attained, when all possibilities would become\r\n",
      "probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the\r\n",
      "next thing to a certainty.  That particular set time and place were\r\n",
      "conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For\r\n",
      "there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\r\n",
      "periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the\r\n",
      "sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one\r\n",
      "sign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of the deadly\r\n",
      "encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were\r\n",
      "storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the\r\n",
      "monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But\r\n",
      "in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with\r\n",
      "which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he\r\n",
      "would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning\r\n",
      "fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;\r\n",
      "nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\r\n",
      "unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of\r\n",
      "the Season-on-the-Line.  No possible endeavor then could enable her\r\n",
      "commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\r\n",
      "then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\r\n",
      "Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the\r\n",
      "next ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing\r\n",
      "had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this\r\n",
      "very complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and\r\n",
      "sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\r\n",
      "of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous\r\n",
      "hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far\r\n",
      "remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his\r\n",
      "wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China\r\n",
      "Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.  So that Monsoons,\r\n",
      "Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter\r\n",
      "and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag\r\n",
      "world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it\r\n",
      "not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one\r\n",
      "solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of\r\n",
      "individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti\r\n",
      "in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the\r\n",
      "peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could\r\n",
      "not but be unmistakable.  And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab\r\n",
      "would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long\r\n",
      "after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him,\r\n",
      "and shall he escape?  His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out\r\n",
      "like a lost sheep's ear!  And here, his mad mind would run on in a\r\n",
      "breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came\r\n",
      "over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover\r\n",
      "his strength.  Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure\r\n",
      "who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire.  He sleeps\r\n",

      "through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and\r\n",
      "whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till\r\n",
      "the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and\r\n",
      "when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved\r\n",
      "his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from\r\n",

      "beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself\r\n",

      "being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright\r\n",

      "Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean.  One day she saw\r\n",
      "spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales.\r\n",

      "large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore\r\n",
      "directly down upon the ship.  Dashing his forehead against her hull,\r\n",
      "he so stove her in, that in less than \"ten minutes\" she settled down\r\n",
      "and fell over.  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.\r\n",
      "After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in\r\n",
      "their boats.  Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more\r\n",
      "sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods\r\n",
      "shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second\r\n",
      "time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he\r\n",
      "has never tempted it since.  At this day Captain Pollard is a\r\n",
      "resident of Nantucket.  I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of\r\n",
      "the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and\r\n",

      "ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to\r\n",
      "their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being\r\n",
      "made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for\r\n",
      "the shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were\r\n",
      "necessary.  His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\r\n",
      "resentment and fury.  He came directly from the shoal which we had\r\n",
      "just before entered, and in which we had struck three of his\r\n",

      "the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso.  But\r\n",
      "he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few\r\n",

      "chapter:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next\r\n",
      "day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The weather\r\n",
      "was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged\r\n",
      "to keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;\r\n",
      "it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest\r\n",
      "sprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger\r\n",
      "than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was\r\n",
      "not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,\r\n",
      "which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was\r\n",
      "impossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed\r\n",
      "in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up\r\n",
      "its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The\r\n",
      "masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below\r\n",
      "all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck\r\n",
      "upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with\r\n",
      "the utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately\r\n",
      "to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any\r\n",
      "damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped\r\n",
      "entirely uninjured.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\r\n",
      "question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\r\n",
      "adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\r\n",
      "Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.\r\n",
      "I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in\r\n",
      "Langsdorff.  He substantiates every word.  The ship, however, was by\r\n",
      "no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,\r\n",
      "and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he\r\n",
      "sailed from home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,\r\n",
      "too, of honest wonders--the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\r\n",
      "Dampier's old chums--I found a little matter set down so like that\r\n",
      "just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here\r\n",
      "for a corroborative example, if such be needed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lionel, it seems, was on his way to \"John Ferdinando,\" as he calls\r\n",
      "the modern Juan Fernandes.  \"In our way thither,\" he says, \"about\r\n",
      "four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\r\n",
      "leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,\r\n",
      "which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell\r\n",
      "where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for\r\n",
      "death.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we\r\n",
      "took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the\r\n",
      "amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found\r\n",
      "no ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in\r\n",
      "their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their\r\n",
      "hammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown\r\n",
      "out of his cabin!\"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an\r\n",
      "earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that\r\n",
      "a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great\r\n",
      "mischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in\r\n",
      "the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after\r\n",
      "all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from\r\n",
      "beneath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known\r\n",
      "to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.  In\r\n",
      "more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the\r\n",
      "assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,\r\n",
      "and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The\r\n",
      "English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for\r\n",
      "his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the\r\n",
      "lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been\r\n",
      "transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her\r\n",
      "great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.\r\n",
      "Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once\r\n",
      "struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with\r\n",
      "blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his\r\n",
      "pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his\r\n",
      "character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his\r\n",
      "mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive\r\n",

      "and Belisarius general.  As many know, he wrote the history of his\r\n",

      "in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having\r\n",
      "destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more\r\n",
      "than fifty years.  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot\r\n",

      "Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary\r\n",
      "coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a\r\n",
      "sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the\r\n",

      "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\r\n",

      "But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\r\n",
      "whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\r\n",
      "large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\r\n",

      "lively, now!'  And with that the pump clanged like fifty\r\n",
      "fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that\r\n",
      "peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman\r\n",

      "Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated\r\n",
      "state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along\r\n",
      "the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the\r\n",
      "planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters\r\n",
      "consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of\r\n",
      "household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly\r\n",
      "attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case\r\n",
      "of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the\r\n",
      "inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\r\n",
      "seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing\r\n",
      "their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the\r\n",
      "prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,\r\n",
      "it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\r\n",
      "gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman\r\n",
      "of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of\r\n",
      "the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial\r\n",
      "business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\r\n",
      "case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you\r\n",

      "spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\r\n",
      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\r\n",
      "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat\r\n",
      "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's\r\n",
      "malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in\r\n",
      "him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\r\n",

      "unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already\r\n",
      "ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really\r\n",

      "then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three\r\n",
      "lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the\r\n",

      "his intention not to obey.  Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\r\n",
      "not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\r\n",
      "his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\r\n",
      "was to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round\r\n",

      "I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\r\n",
      "something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to\r\n",
      "the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is\r\n",
      "moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon\r\n",
      "there.  It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to\r\n",
      "those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the\r\n",
      "present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.  It is\r\n",
      "time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures\r\n",
      "of the whale all wrong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions\r\n",
      "will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian\r\n",
      "sculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times\r\n",
      "when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,\r\n",
      "and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in\r\n",
      "scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.\r\n",
      "George's; ever since then has something of the same sort of license\r\n",
      "prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in\r\n",
      "many scientific presentations of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\r\n",
      "to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\r\n",
      "Elephanta, in India.  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost\r\n",
      "endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and\r\n",
      "pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages\r\n",
      "before any of them actually came into being.  No wonder then, that in\r\n",
      "some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there\r\n",
      "shadowed forth.  The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate\r\n",
      "department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the\r\n",
      "form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.  But though\r\n",
      "this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the\r\n",
      "tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.  It\r\n",
      "looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms\r\n",
      "of the true whale's majestic flukes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\r\n",
      "painter's portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the\r\n",
      "antediluvian Hindoo.  It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing\r\n",
      "Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale.  Where did Guido get the\r\n",
      "model of such a strange creature as that?  Nor does Hogarth, in\r\n",
      "painting the same scene in his own \"Perseus Descending,\" make out one\r\n",
      "whit better.  The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster\r\n",
      "undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.  It has\r\n",
      "a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into\r\n",
      "which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate\r\n",
      "leading from the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the\r\n",
      "Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as\r\n",
      "depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.\r\n",
      "What shall be said of these?  As for the book-binder's whale winding\r\n",
      "like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as stamped\r\n",
      "and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and\r\n",
      "new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,\r\n",
      "imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.  Though\r\n",
      "universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this\r\n",
      "book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended\r\n",
      "when the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old\r\n",
      "Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\r\n",
      "Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\r\n",
      "comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\r\n",
      "species of the Leviathan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\r\n",

      "manner of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\r\n",
      "Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain.  In the\r\n",

      "you will find some curious whales.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at\r\n",
      "those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific\r\n",
      "delineations, by those who know.  In old Harris's collection of\r\n",
      "voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book\r\n",
      "of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled \"A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in\r\n",
      "the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\"\r\n",
      "In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are\r\n",
      "represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over\r\n",
      "their living backs.  In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made\r\n",
      "of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\r\n",
      "Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled \"A Voyage round\r\n",
      "Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\r\n",

      "from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on\r\n",
      "deck.\"  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for\r\n",
      "the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one thing about it, let\r\n",
      "me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the\r\n",
      "accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye\r\n",
      "of that whale a bow-window some five feet long.  Ah, my gallant\r\n",

      "Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for\r\n",

      "great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same\r\n",
      "relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does\r\n",
      "to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.  This peculiarity\r\n",
      "is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will\r\n",

      "bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.  But all\r\n",

      "the ship by the towing whale.  So close did the monster come to the\r\n",

      "the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's\r\n",
      "side.  But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not\r\n",
      "sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the\r\n",
      "same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship.\r\n",
      "For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while\r\n",
      "they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still\r\n",
      "plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take\r\n",
      "them under.  But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain.\r\n",
      "And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift\r\n",
      "tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the\r\n",
      "strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under\r\n",
      "her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings,\r\n",
      "that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\r\n",
      "Whale are by far the most noteworthy.  They are the only whales\r\n",
      "regularly hunted by man.  To the Nantucketer, they present the two\r\n",
      "extremes of all the known varieties of the whale.  As the external\r\n",
      "difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\r\n",
      "head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we\r\n",

      "deck:--where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance\r\n",
      "to study practical cetology than here?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\r\n",
      "these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there\r\n",
      "is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the\r\n",
      "Right Whale's sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm\r\n",
      "Whale's head.  As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense\r\n",
      "superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present\r\n",
      "instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt\r\n",
      "colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and\r\n",
      "large experience.  In short, he is what the fishermen technically\r\n",
      "call a \"grey-headed whale.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the\r\n",
      "two most important organs, the eye and the ear.  Far back on the side\r\n",
      "of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if\r\n",
      "you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you\r\n",
      "would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it\r\n",
      "to the magnitude of the head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is\r\n",
      "plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\r\n",
      "than he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position of the\r\n",
      "whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy,\r\n",
      "for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey\r\n",
      "objects through your ears.  You would find that you could only\r\n",
      "command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight\r\n",
      "side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it.  If your\r\n",
      "bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted\r\n",
      "in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he\r\n",
      "were stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have two\r\n",
      "backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\r\n",
      "fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--what, indeed,\r\n",
      "but his eyes?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the\r\n",
      "eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so\r\n",
      "as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar\r\n",
      "position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many\r\n",
      "cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great\r\n",
      "mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must\r\n",
      "wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.\r\n",
      "The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,\r\n",
      "and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be\r\n",
      "profound darkness and nothingness to him.  Man may, in effect, be\r\n",
      "said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined\r\n",
      "sashes for his window.  But with the whale, these two sashes are\r\n",
      "separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing\r\n",
      "the view.  This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to\r\n",
      "be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader\r\n",
      "in some subsequent scenes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\r\n",
      "visual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content with\r\n",
      "a hint.  So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of\r\n",
      "seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically\r\n",
      "seeing whatever objects are before him.  Nevertheless, any one's\r\n",
      "experience will teach him, that though he can take in an\r\n",
      "undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite\r\n",
      "impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two\r\n",
      "things--however large or however small--at one and the same instant\r\n",
      "of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.\r\n",
      "But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each\r\n",
      "by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,\r\n",
      "in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will\r\n",
      "be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.  How is it,\r\n",
      "then, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\r\n",
      "simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\r\n",
      "combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of\r\n",
      "time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of\r\n",
      "him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?  If he can, then\r\n",
      "is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\r\n",
      "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\r\n",
      "problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\r\n",
      "incongruity in this comparison.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\r\n",
      "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\r\n",
      "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\r\n",
      "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\r\n",
      "proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\r\n",
      "divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve\r\n",
      "them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye.  If you are\r\n",
      "an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads\r\n",
      "for hours, and never discover that organ.  The ear has no external\r\n",
      "leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a\r\n",
      "quill, so wondrously minute is it.  It is lodged a little behind the\r\n",
      "eye.  With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be\r\n",
      "observed between the sperm whale and the right.  While the ear of\r\n",
      "the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely\r\n",

      "upon its thousand pipes?  For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of\r\n",
      "the softest Turkey--the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the\r\n",

      "then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and\r\n",
      "upwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the head.  He averred, that\r\n",
      "upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well\r\n",
      "knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great\r\n",
      "trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and\r\n",
      "toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next\r\n",
      "trial, he came forth in the good old way--head foremost.  As for the\r\n",

      "And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\r\n",

      "those negations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his\r\n",
      "prodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the truest,\r\n",
      "though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted\r\n",
      "potency is.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain,\r\n",
      "you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have\r\n",
      "another idea for you.  If you attentively regard almost any\r\n",
      "quadruped's spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its\r\n",
      "vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing\r\n",
      "rudimental resemblance to the skull proper.  It is a German conceit,\r\n",
      "that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls.  But the\r\n",
      "curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the\r\n",
      "first men to perceive.  A foreign friend once pointed it out to me,\r\n",
      "in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of\r\n",
      "which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow\r\n",
      "of his canoe.  Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an\r\n",
      "important thing in not pushing their investigations from the\r\n",
      "cerebellum through the spinal canal.  For I believe that much of a\r\n",
      "man's character will be found betokened in his backbone.  I would\r\n",
      "rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are.  A thin\r\n",
      "joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul.  I rejoice\r\n",
      "in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I\r\n",
      "fling half out to the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale.  His\r\n",
      "cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in\r\n",
      "that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches\r\n",
      "across, being eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the\r\n",
      "base downwards.  As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the\r\n",
      "canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of\r\n",
      "large capacity.  Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the\r\n",
      "same strangely fibrous substance--the spinal cord--as the brain; and\r\n",
      "directly communicates with the brain.  And what is still more, for\r\n",
      "many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord\r\n",
      "remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.\r\n",
      "Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and\r\n",
      "map out the whale's spine phrenologically?  For, viewed in this\r\n",
      "light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is\r\n",
      "more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his\r\n",
      "spinal cord.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\r\n",
      "would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to\r\n",
      "the Sperm Whale's hump.  This august hump, if I mistake not, rises\r\n",
      "over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort,\r\n",
      "the outer convex mould of it.  From its relative situation then, I\r\n",
      "should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness\r\n",
      "in the Sperm Whale.  And that the great monster is indomitable, you\r\n",
      "will yet have reason to know.\r\n",

      "must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\r\n",
      "muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile\r\n",

      "to sound, for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of\r\n",
      "expending more line, though the position was a little ticklish.  But\r\n",
      "though boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is\r\n",

      "reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under\r\n",
      "water, the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous\r\n",
      "surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000\r\n",
      "square feet--the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what\r\n",

      "whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!\r\n",
      "It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman\r\n",

      "be said to pour from him in incessant streams.  Yet so vast is the\r\n",
      "quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior\r\n",
      "fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a\r\n",
      "considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose\r\n",

      "Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at\r\n",
      "different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\r\n",
      "whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.  By\r\n",
      "very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was\r\n",
      "transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the\r\n",

      "upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the\r\n",
      "spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in\r\n",
      "his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.  But as\r\n",
      "the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of\r\n",
      "captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no\r\n",
      "prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must\r\n",
      "needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully\r\n",
      "to account for the ulceration alluded to.  But still more curious was\r\n",
      "the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from\r\n",
      "the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.  Who had darted\r\n",
      "that stone lance?  And when?  It might have been darted by some Nor'\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\r\n",

      "discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over\r\n",
      "sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing\r\n",
      "tendency to sink.  However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of\r\n",
      "affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely,\r\n",
      "indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if\r\n",
      "still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the\r\n",
      "command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable\r\n",
      "strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables\r\n",
      "were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off.  Meantime\r\n",
      "everything in the Pequod was aslant.  To cross to the other side of\r\n",
      "the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house.  The\r\n",
      "ship groaned and gasped.  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks\r\n",
      "and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\r\n",
      "dislocation.  In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon\r\n",
      "the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads;\r\n",
      "and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could\r\n",
      "not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of\r\n",
      "ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on\r\n",
      "the point of going over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don't be in\r\n",
      "such a devil of a hurry to sink!  By thunder, men, we must do\r\n",
      "something or go for it.  No use prying there; avast, I say with your\r\n",

      "cut the big chains.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Knife?  Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy\r\n",
      "hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began\r\n",
      "slashing at the largest fluke-chains.  But a few strokes, full of\r\n",
      "sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.\r\n",
      "With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted,\r\n",

      "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\r\n",
      "Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\r\n",
      "accounted for it.  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\r\n",
      "buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\r\n",
      "surface.  If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\r\n",
      "broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\r\n",
      "bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert\r\n",
      "that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the\r\n",
      "fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in\r\n",
      "him.  But it is not so.  For young whales, in the highest health, and\r\n",
      "swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm\r\n",
      "flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "accident than any other species.  Where one of that sort go down,\r\n",
      "twenty Right Whales do.  This difference in the species is no doubt\r\n",
      "imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the\r\n",
      "Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a\r\n",
      "ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.  But there\r\n",
      "are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,\r\n",
      "the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.  But the\r\n",
      "reason of this is obvious.  Gases are generated in him; he swells to\r\n",
      "a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon.  A\r\n",
      "line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.  In the Shore\r\n",
      "Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right\r\n",

      "lodged in some part of his mouth.  And this seems reasonable enough\r\n",

      "gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\r\n",
      "is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or\r\n",
      "a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\r\n",
      "surface.  But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\r\n",
      "regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by\r\n",
      "inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere.  Wherefore the\r\n",
      "necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world.  But he\r\n",
      "cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary\r\n",
      "attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet\r\n",
      "beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no\r\n",
      "connexion with his mouth.  No, he breathes through his spiracle\r\n",
      "alone; and this is on the top of his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\r\n",
      "indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\r\n",
      "certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with\r\n",
      "the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not\r\n",
      "think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous\r\n",
      "scientific words.  Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in\r\n",
      "a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his\r\n",
      "nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time.  That is to\r\n",
      "say, he would then live without breathing.  Anomalous as it may seem,\r\n",
      "this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives,\r\n",
      "by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without\r\n",
      "drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle\r\n",
      "of air; for, remember, he has no gills.  How is this?  Between his\r\n",
      "ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable\r\n",
      "involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels,\r\n",
      "when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated\r\n",
      "blood.  So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,\r\n",
      "he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel\r\n",
      "crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for\r\n",
      "future use in its four supplementary stomachs.  The anatomical fact\r\n",
      "of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded\r\n",
      "upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I\r\n",
      "consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in\r\n",
      "HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase it.  This is what I\r\n",
      "mean.  If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale\r\n",
      "will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his\r\n",
      "other unmolested risings.  Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets\r\n",
      "seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he\r\n",
      "rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again,\r\n",
      "to a minute.  Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,\r\n",
      "so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good\r\n",
      "his regular allowance of air.  And not till those seventy breaths are\r\n",

      "his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?  How obvious is it,\r\n",
      "too, that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all\r\n",
      "the fatal hazards of the chase.  For not by hook or by net could\r\n",

      "furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward\r\n",
      "retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the\r\n",
      "whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so\r\n",

      "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\r\n",
      "for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\r\n",

      "little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe\r\n",

      "whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled\r\n",
      "breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in\r\n",
      "at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle.  It is certain\r\n",
      "that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but\r\n",
      "it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\r\n",
      "through the spiracle.  Because the greatest necessity for so doing\r\n",
      "would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.\r\n",
      "But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he\r\n",

      "closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when\r\n",

      "The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist\r\n",

      "from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a\r\n",
      "close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water\r\n",
      "cascading all around him.  And if at such times you should think that\r\n",
      "you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know\r\n",
      "that they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know\r\n",
      "that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the\r\n",
      "spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the\r\n",
      "whale's head?  For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day\r\n",
      "sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in\r\n",
      "the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of\r\n",

      "peeled off from his cheek and arm.  Wherefore, among whalemen, the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\r\n",
      "and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less\r\n",
      "celestial, I celebrate a tail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point\r\n",
      "of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it\r\n",
      "comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty\r\n",
      "square feet.  The compact round body of its root expands into two\r\n",
      "broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less\r\n",
      "than an inch in thickness.  At the crotch or junction, these flukes\r\n",
      "slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,\r\n",
      "leaving a wide vacancy between.  In no living thing are the lines of\r\n",
      "beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of\r\n",
      "these flukes.  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the\r\n",
      "tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\r\n",
      "into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,\r\n",
      "middle, and lower.  The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are\r\n",
      "long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\r\n",
      "crosswise between the outside layers.  This triune structure, as much\r\n",
      "as anything else, imparts power to the tail.  To the student of old\r\n",
      "Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the\r\n",
      "thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those\r\n",
      "wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so\r\n",
      "much to the great strength of the masonry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not\r\n",
      "enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and\r\n",
      "woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side\r\n",
      "the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with\r\n",
      "them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the\r\n",
      "confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to\r\n",
      "a point.  Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to\r\n",
      "do it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the\r\n",
      "graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease\r\n",
      "undulates through a Titanism of power.  On the contrary, those\r\n",
      "motions derive their most appalling beauty from it.  Real strength\r\n",
      "never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in\r\n",
      "everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the\r\n",
      "magic.  Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from\r\n",
      "the marble in the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone.  As\r\n",
      "devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of\r\n",
      "Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that\r\n",
      "seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.  When Angelo paints even God the\r\n",
      "Father in human form, mark what robustness is there.  And whatever\r\n",
      "they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,\r\n",
      "hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most\r\n",
      "successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of\r\n",
      "all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative,\r\n",
      "feminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is\r\n",
      "conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\r\n",
      "wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\r\n",
      "be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace.\r\n",
      "Therein no fairy's arm can transcend it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Five great motions are peculiar to it.  First, when used as a fin for\r\n",
      "progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in\r\n",
      "sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in\r\n",
      "a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.  It\r\n",
      "never wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.\r\n",
      "To the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.  Scroll-wise\r\n",
      "coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,\r\n",
      "it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the\r\n",
      "monster when furiously swimming.  His side-fins only serve to steer\r\n",
      "by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\r\n",
      "fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in\r\n",
      "his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.\r\n",
      "In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and\r\n",
      "the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made in the\r\n",
      "unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is\r\n",
      "then simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.\r\n",
      "Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\r\n",
      "through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy\r\n",
      "of the whale boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked\r\n",
      "rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is\r\n",
      "generally the most serious result.  These submerged side blows are so\r\n",
      "often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child's\r\n",
      "play.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\r\n",
      "the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\r\n",
      "there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\r\n",
      "elephant's trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\r\n",
      "sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\r\n",
      "slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\r\n",
      "the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,\r\n",
      "whiskers and all.  What tenderness there is in that preliminary\r\n",
      "touch!  Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway\r\n",
      "bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the\r\n",
      "flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to\r\n",
      "damsels, and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one, a\r\n",
      "pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in\r\n",
      "his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded\r\n",
      "in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of\r\n",
      "the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast\r\n",
      "corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as\r\n",
      "if it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.  The\r\n",
      "broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting\r\n",
      "the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.  You would\r\n",
      "almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the\r\n",
      "light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you\r\n",
      "would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the\r\n",
      "flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then\r\n",
      "completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to\r\n",
      "plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of\r\n",
      "his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a\r\n",
      "moment, till they downwards shoot out of view.  Excepting the sublime\r\n",
      "BREACH--somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale's\r\n",
      "flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated\r\n",
      "nature.  Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems\r\n",
      "spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven.  So in dreams, have I\r\n",
      "seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from\r\n",
      "the flame Baltic of Hell.  But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in\r\n",
      "all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to\r\n",
      "you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.  Standing at the mast-head\r\n",
      "of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a\r\n",
      "large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and\r\n",
      "for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.  As it seemed\r\n",
      "to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods\r\n",
      "was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.\r\n",
      "As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then\r\n",
      "testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all\r\n",
      "beings.  For according to King Juba, the military elephants of\r\n",
      "antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the\r\n",
      "profoundest silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\r\n",
      "elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\r\n",
      "of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two\r\n",
      "opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\r\n",
      "respectively belong.  For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier\r\n",
      "to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but\r\n",
      "the stalk of a lily.  The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk\r\n",
      "were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush\r\n",
      "and crash of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated\r\n",
      "instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their\r\n",

      "to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of\r\n",
      "curious similitude; among these is the spout.  It is well known that\r\n",
      "the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then\r\n",

      "inexplicable.  In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are\r\n",
      "these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared\r\n",
      "them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by\r\n",

      "and never will.  But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how\r\n",
      "understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he\r\n",
      "has none?  Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say,\r\n",

      "something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so\r\n",

      "her on to her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to\r\n",
      "her, that they were.  As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced\r\n",

      "remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were\r\n",
      "infernally cheering him on with their curses;--when all these\r\n",
      "conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's brow was left gaunt and\r\n",
      "ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been\r\n",
      "gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\r\n",
      "when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\r\n",

      "victoriously gained upon the Malays.  But still driving on in the\r\n",
      "wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed;\r\n",
      "gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was\r\n",
      "passed to spring to the boats.  But no sooner did the herd, by some\r\n",
      "presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of\r\n",
      "the three keels that were after them,--though as yet a mile in their\r\n",
      "rear,--than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and\r\n",
      "battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of\r\n",
      "stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\r\n",
      "after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\r\n",
      "chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave\r\n",
      "animating token that they were now at last under the influence of\r\n",
      "that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the\r\n",
      "fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied.  The\r\n",
      "compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and\r\n",
      "steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and\r\n",
      "like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\r\n",
      "seemed going mad with consternation.  In all directions expanding in\r\n",
      "vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by\r\n",
      "their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction\r\n",
      "of panic.  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their\r\n",
      "number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like\r\n",
      "water-logged dismantled ships on the sea.  Had these Leviathans been\r\n",
      "but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce\r\n",
      "wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay.\r\n",
      "But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding\r\n",
      "creatures.  Though banding together in tens of thousands, the\r\n",
      "lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary\r\n",
      "horseman.  Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together\r\n",
      "in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest\r\n",
      "alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\r\n",
      "trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death.\r\n",
      "Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied\r\n",
      "whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth\r\n",
      "which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\r\n",
      "yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced\r\n",
      "nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.  As is\r\n",
      "customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making\r\n",
      "for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.  In about\r\n",
      "three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish\r\n",
      "darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like\r\n",
      "light, steered straight for the heart of the herd.  Though such a\r\n",
      "movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is\r\n",
      "in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less\r\n",
      "anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous\r\n",
      "vicissitudes of the fishery.  For as the swift monster drags you\r\n",
      "deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to\r\n",
      "circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power\r\n",
      "of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;\r\n",
      "as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we\r\n",
      "flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset\r\n",
      "boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving\r\n",
      "to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at\r\n",
      "what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\r\n",
      "from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging\r\n",
      "away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while\r\n",
      "all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking\r\n",
      "out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for\r\n",
      "there was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen quite\r\n",
      "idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.\r\n",
      "They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  \"Out of\r\n",
      "the way, Commodore!\" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden\r\n",
      "rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp\r\n",
      "us.  \"Hard down with your tail, there!\" cried a second to another,\r\n",
      "which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his\r\n",
      "own fan-like extremity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally\r\n",
      "invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.  Two thick squares\r\n",
      "of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they\r\n",
      "cross each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable\r\n",
      "length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other\r\n",
      "end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a\r\n",
      "harpoon.  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.\r\n",
      "For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly\r\n",
      "chase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every day encountered;\r\n",
      "while you may, then, you must kill all you can.  And if you cannot\r\n",
      "kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be\r\n",
      "afterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is, that at times like\r\n",
      "these the drugg, comes into requisition.  Our boat was furnished with\r\n",
      "three of them.  The first and second were successfully darted, and we\r\n",
      "saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous\r\n",
      "sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.  They were cramped like\r\n",
      "malefactors with the chain and ball.  But upon flinging the third, in\r\n",
      "the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under\r\n",
      "one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and\r\n",
      "carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the\r\n",
      "seat slid from under him.  On both sides the sea came in at the\r\n",
      "wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,\r\n",
      "and so stopped the leaks for the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were\r\n",
      "it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly\r\n",
      "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\r\n",
      "the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.\r\n",
      "So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing\r\n",
      "whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\r\n",
      "momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of\r\n",
      "the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\r\n",
      "valley lake.  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the\r\n",
      "outermost whales, were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse\r\n",
      "the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,\r\n",
      "produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more\r\n",
      "quiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say\r\n",
      "lurks at the heart of every commotion.  And still in the distracted\r\n",
      "distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and\r\n",
      "saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going\r\n",
      "round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so\r\n",
      "closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might\r\n",
      "easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on\r\n",
      "their backs.  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,\r\n",
      "more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no\r\n",
      "possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.  We must watch\r\n",
      "for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had\r\n",
      "only admitted us in order to shut us up.  Keeping at the centre of\r\n",
      "the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;\r\n",
      "the women and children of this routed host.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\r\n",
      "outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods\r\n",
      "in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture,\r\n",
      "embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or\r\n",
      "three square miles.  At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a\r\n",
      "time might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low\r\n",
      "boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.  I\r\n",
      "mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had\r\n",
      "been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide\r\n",
      "extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the\r\n",
      "precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,\r\n",
      "unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it\r\n",
      "may have been, these smaller whales--now and then visiting our\r\n",
      "becalmed boat from the margin of the lake--evinced a wondrous\r\n",
      "fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it\r\n",
      "was impossible not to marvel at.  Like household dogs they came\r\n",
      "snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till\r\n",
      "it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them.\r\n",
      "Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with\r\n",
      "his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained\r\n",
      "from darting it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and\r\n",
      "still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side.  For,\r\n",
      "suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing\r\n",
      "mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed\r\n",
      "shortly to become mothers.  The lake, as I have hinted, was to a\r\n",
      "considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants\r\n",
      "while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as\r\n",
      "if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing\r\n",
      "mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly\r\n",
      "reminiscence;--even so did the young of these whales seem looking up\r\n",
      "towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in\r\n",
      "their new-born sight.  Floating on their sides, the mothers also\r\n",
      "seemed quietly eyeing us.  One of these little infants, that from\r\n",
      "certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured\r\n",
      "some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth.  He was a\r\n",
      "little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered\r\n",
      "from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal\r\n",
      "reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring,\r\n",
      "the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow.  The delicate\r\n",
      "side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the\r\n",
      "plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from\r\n",
      "foreign parts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Line! line!\" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \"him fast!\r\n",
      "him fast!--Who line him!  Who struck?--Two whale; one big, one\r\n",
      "little!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What ails ye, man?\" cried Starbuck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look-e here,\" said Queequeg, pointing down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds\r\n",
      "of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and\r\n",
      "shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling\r\n",
      "towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical\r\n",
      "cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still\r\n",
      "tethered to its dam.  Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the\r\n",
      "chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes\r\n",
      "entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped.\r\n",
      "Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in\r\n",
      "this enchanted pond.  We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\r\n",
      "unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\r\n",
      "gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing\r\n",
      "but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to\r\n",
      "an Esau and Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two\r\n",
      "teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the\r\n",
      "breasts themselves extend upwards from that.  When by chance these\r\n",
      "precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the\r\n",
      "mother's pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for\r\n",
      "rods.  The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it\r\n",
      "might do well with strawberries.  When overflowing with mutual\r\n",
      "esteem, the whales salute MORE HOMINUM.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations\r\n",

      "possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance\r\n",

      "sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to\r\n",

      "It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly\r\n",
      "powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\r\n",
      "spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he\r\n",
      "seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at\r\n",
      "first the intervening distance obscured from us.  But at length we\r\n",
      "perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery,\r\n",

      "end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in\r\n",
      "the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade\r\n",
      "itself had worked loose from his flesh.  So that tormented to\r\n",

      "Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\r\n",

      "scene presented itself.  The sailors, in tasselled caps of red\r\n",
      "worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales.\r\n",
      "But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in\r\n",
      "anything but a good humor.  All their noses upwardly projected from\r\n",
      "their faces like so many jib-booms.  Now and then pairs of them would\r\n",
      "drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.\r\n",
      "Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar,\r\n",
      "and at intervals held it to their nostrils.  Others having broken the\r\n",
      "stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously\r\n",
      "puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their\r\n",
      "olfactories.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding\r\n",
      "from the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction\r\n",
      "saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar\r\n",
      "from within.  This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\r\n",
      "remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\r\n",
      "to the Captain's round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the\r\n",
      "pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\r\n",
      "indignations at times.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to\r\n",
      "the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the\r\n",
      "stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited\r\n",
      "ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable\r\n",
      "a pickle.  Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the\r\n",
      "Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the\r\n",
      "ambergris.  He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise\r\n",
      "was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly\r\n",
      "concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the\r\n",
      "Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.\r\n",
      "According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under\r\n",
      "cover of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what he\r\n",
      "pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter\r\n",
      "any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\r\n",

      "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as\r\n",

      "itself, a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but\r\n",
      "the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite\r\n",
      "distinct.  For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also\r\n",
      "dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found\r\n",

      "odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\r\n",
      "ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and\r\n",
      "spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious\r\n",
      "candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in cooking, and\r\n",

      "to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\r\n",

      "of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\r\n",

      "be sailors' trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they\r\n",

      "incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory.\r\n",

      "did this odious stigma originate?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\r\n",
      "Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.\r\n",
      "Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their\r\n",
      "oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the\r\n",
      "fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of\r\n",
      "large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the\r\n",
      "season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which\r\n",
      "they are exposed, forbidding any other course.  The consequence is,\r\n",
      "that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale\r\n",
      "cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat\r\n",
      "similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for\r\n",
      "the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\r\n",
      "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in\r\n",
      "former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,\r\n",
      "which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in\r\n",
      "his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.  As its name\r\n",
      "imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in\r\n",
      "order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to\r\n",
      "be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.\r\n",
      "It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when\r\n",
      "the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very\r\n",
      "pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different with a South Sea\r\n",
      "Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after\r\n",
      "completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume\r\n",
      "fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it\r\n",
      "is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or\r\n",
      "dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means\r\n",
      "creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people\r\n",
      "of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the\r\n",
      "nose.  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,\r\n",
      "when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking\r\n",
      "abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,\r\n",
      "seldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's\r\n",

      "even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony,\r\n",
      "panelled in king's cabinets.  But Pip loved life, and all life's\r\n",
      "peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he\r\n",
      "had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred\r\n",

      "lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the\r\n",

      "effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once\r\n",
      "the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel\r\n",
      "stolen from the King of Hell.  But let us to the story.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman\r\n",
      "chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\r\n",
      "and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\r\n",
      "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\r\n",
      "therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb\r\n",
      "observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his\r\n",
      "courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\r\n",
      "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\r\n",
      "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.  The\r\n",
      "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\r\n",
      "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack\r\n",
      "whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with\r\n",
      "him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the\r\n",
      "water.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the\r\n",
      "line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up\r\n",
      "to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,\r\n",
      "which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He\r\n",
      "hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\r\n",
      "he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\r\n",
      "exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\"  Meantime Pip's blue, choked face\r\n",
      "plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less\r\n",
      "than half a minute, this entire thing happened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\r\n",
      "saved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed\r\n",
      "by yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting these\r\n",
      "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,\r\n",
      "business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;\r\n",
      "and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The\r\n",
      "substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest\r\n",
      "was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.  Now, in general,\r\n",
      "STICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will\r\n",
      "sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is still better.  Moreover,\r\n",
      "as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted\r\n",
      "conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a\r\n",
      "margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,\r\n",
      "and concluded with a peremptory command, \"Stick to the boat, Pip, or\r\n",
      "by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can't\r\n",
      "afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for\r\n",
      "thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind, and\r\n",
      "don't jump any more.\"  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that\r\n",
      "though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\r\n",
      "propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.  It\r\n",
      "was under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but\r\n",
      "this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale\r\n",
      "started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried\r\n",
      "traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.  It\r\n",
      "was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and\r\n",
      "cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like\r\n",
      "gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest.  Bobbing up and\r\n",
      "down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves.  No\r\n",
      "boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.  Stubb's\r\n",
      "inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.  In\r\n",
      "three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and\r\n",
      "Stubb.  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp,\r\n",
      "curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the\r\n",
      "loftiest and the brightest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\r\n",
      "practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.  But the\r\n",
      "awful lonesomeness is intolerable.  The intense concentration of self\r\n",
      "in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?\r\n",
      "Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark\r\n",
      "how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?\r\n",
      "No; he did not mean to, at least.  Because there were two boats in\r\n",
      "his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come\r\n",
      "up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such\r\n",
      "considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own\r\n",
      "timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar\r\n",
      "instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost\r\n",
      "invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the\r\n",
      "same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed\r\n",

      "boat's bow.  He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured,\r\n",
      "fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious\r\n",

      "his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but\r\n",
      "his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy\r\n",
      "mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be\r\n",
      "rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning.  Now,\r\n",
      "it is no very easy matter for anybody--except those who are almost\r\n",
      "hourly used to it, like whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a\r\n",
      "boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up\r\n",
      "towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down\r\n",

      "course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab\r\n",

      "circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\r\n",
      "luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.\r\n",
      "And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of\r\n",
      "the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\r\n",
      "perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him\r\n",
      "a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not\r\n",
      "seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a\r\n",
      "cripple to use their sea bannisters.  But this awkwardness only\r\n",
      "lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance\r\n",

      "curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the\r\n",
      "end.  This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it\r\n",
      "all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like\r\n",
      "sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree),\r\n",
      "and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time\r\n",
      "also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon\r\n",
      "one of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung\r\n",
      "inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.\r\n",
      "With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain\r\n",
      "advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory\r\n",
      "arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, \"Aye,\r\n",
      "aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm\r\n",
      "that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run.  Where\r\n",

      "my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too,\r\n",

      "only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.\r\n",
      "Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great\r\n",

      "\"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.\"\r\n",

      "\"Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs\r\n",

      "somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards\r\n",
      "pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of\r\n",
      "the other whale's; that went off to windward, all fluking.  Seeing\r\n",
      "how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was--the noblest\r\n",
      "and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him,\r\n",
      "spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in.  And thinking the\r\n",
      "hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to\r\n",
      "might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a\r\n",
      "whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's\r\n",
      "boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;\r\n",
      "Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's\r\n",

      "But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next\r\n",
      "instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged\r\n",
      "and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail looming straight up\r\n",
      "out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.  No use\r\n",
      "sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding\r\n",
      "sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second\r\n",
      "iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima tower,\r\n",
      "cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes\r\n",
      "first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all\r\n",
      "chips.  We all struck out.  To escape his terrible flailings, I\r\n",
      "seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment\r\n",
      "clung to that like a sucking fish.  But a combing sea dashed me off,\r\n",
      "and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards,\r\n",
      "went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron\r\n",

      "At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all\r\n",
      "this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were\r\n",

      "woof, and the living flowers the figures.  All the trees, with all\r\n",
      "their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the\r\n",
      "message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active.  Through the\r\n",
      "lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving\r\n",

      "Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed\r\n",

      "Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw\r\n",

      "real jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel\r\n",
      "as an object of vertu.  He laughed.  But more I marvelled that the\r\n",
      "priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine.  To and fro I\r\n",
      "paced before this skeleton--brushed the vines aside--broke through\r\n",
      "the ribs--and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long\r\n",
      "amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours.  But soon my\r\n",
      "line was out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "each other's sconces with their yard-sticks--the great skull\r\n",
      "echoed--and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own\r\n",

      "statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton\r\n",
      "we are briefly to exhibit.  Such a statement may prove useful here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly\r\n",

      "largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to\r\n",

      "magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and\r\n",
      "something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a\r\n",
      "whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen\r\n",

      "imagination?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,\r\n",
      "jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\r\n",
      "simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\r\n",
      "unobstructed bones.  But as the colossal skull embraces so very large\r\n",
      "a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far\r\n",
      "the most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated\r\n",

      "mind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a\r\n",
      "complete notion of the general structure we are about to view.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\r\n",
      "Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\r\n",
      "been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\r\n",
      "fifth in length compared with the living body.  Of this seventy-two\r\n",
      "feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some\r\n",
      "fifty feet of plain back-bone.  Attached to this back-bone, for\r\n",
      "something less than a third of its length, was the mighty circular\r\n",
      "basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\r\n",
      "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\r\n",
      "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\r\n",
      "twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\r\n",
      "for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ribs were ten on a side.  The first, to begin from the neck, was\r\n",
      "nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\r\n",
      "successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\r\n",
      "of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches.  From\r\n",
      "that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last\r\n",
      "only spanned five feet and some inches.  In general thickness, they\r\n",
      "all bore a seemly correspondence to their length.  The middle ribs\r\n",
      "were the most arched.  In some of the Arsacides they are used for\r\n",
      "beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\r\n",
      "circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton\r\n",
      "of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form.  The\r\n",
      "largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that\r\n",
      "part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth.  Now, the\r\n",
      "greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must\r\n",
      "have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib\r\n",
      "measured but little more than eight feet.  So that this rib only\r\n",
      "conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that\r\n",
      "part.  Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all\r\n",
      "that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh,\r\n",
      "muscle, blood, and bowels.  Still more, for the ample fins, I here\r\n",
      "saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and\r\n",
      "majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to\r\n",
      "try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over\r\n",
      "his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.  No.\r\n",
      "Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings\r\n",
      "of his angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the\r\n",
      "fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the spine.  For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\r\n",
      "crane, to pile its bones high up on end.  No speedy enterprise.  But\r\n",
      "now it's done, it looks much like Pompey's Pillar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are\r\n",
      "not locked together.  They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks\r\n",
      "on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry.  The\r\n",
      "largest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet,\r\n",
      "and in depth more than four.  The smallest, where the spine tapers\r\n",
      "away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something\r\n",
      "like a white billiard-ball.  I was told that there were still smaller\r\n",
      "ones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the\r\n",
      "priest's children, who had stolen them to play marbles with.  Thus we\r\n",

      "canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for\r\n",
      "it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a\r\n",
      "dead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be\r\n",

      "horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue\r\n",
      "heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way.  He added,\r\n",
      "that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,\r\n",
      "according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the\r\n",
      "death-devouring sharks.  No: he desired a canoe like those of\r\n",

      "Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter\r\n",

      "stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin\r\n",
      "along with one of the paddles of his boat.  All by his own request,\r\n",
      "also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of\r\n",
      "fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth\r\n",
      "scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being\r\n",
      "rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his\r\n",
      "final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had.\r\n",
      "He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag\r\n",
      "and bring out his little god, Yojo.  Then crossing his arms on his\r\n",
      "breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he\r\n",
      "called it) to be placed over him.  The head part turned over with a\r\n",
      "leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but\r\n",
      "his composed countenance in view.  \"Rarmai\" (it will do; it is easy),\r\n",
      "he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.\r\n",

      "soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon,\r\n",
      "when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said,\r\n",
      "that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical\r\n",
      "moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was\r\n",
      "leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he\r\n",
      "could not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, then, whether to live\r\n",
      "or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.  He\r\n",
      "answered, certainly.  In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a\r\n",
      "man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:\r\n",
      "nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,\r\n",
      "unintelligent destroyer of that sort.\r\n",

      "Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and\r\n",

      "Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of\r\n",

      "his body.  And this tattooing had been the work of a departed\r\n",

      "rigging, where they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number\r\n",

      "have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely\r\n",
      "there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and\r\n",
      "longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a\r\n",
      "vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually\r\n",
      "encountered Moby Dick;--and now that all his successive meetings with\r\n",
      "various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac\r\n",
      "indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether\r\n",
      "sinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a something\r\n",
      "in the old man's eyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble\r\n",
      "souls to see.  As the unsetting polar star, which through the\r\n",
      "livelong, arctic, six months' night sustains its piercing, steady,\r\n",
      "central gaze; so Ahab's purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the\r\n",
      "constant midnight of the gloomy crew.  It domineered above them so,\r\n",
      "that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide\r\n",
      "beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,\r\n",
      "vanished.  Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more\r\n",
      "strove to check one.  Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed\r\n",
      "ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped\r\n",
      "mortar of Ahab's iron soul.  Like machines, they dumbly moved about\r\n",
      "the deck, ever conscious that the old man's despot eye was on them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours;\r\n",
      "when he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have\r\n",
      "seen that even as Ahab's eyes so awed the crew's, the inscrutable\r\n",
      "Parsee's glance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at\r\n",
      "times affected it.  Such an added, gliding strangeness began to\r\n",
      "invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him;\r\n",
      "that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it seemed,\r\n",
      "whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow\r\n",
      "cast upon the deck by some unseen being's body.  And that shadow was\r\n",
      "always hovering there.  For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever\r\n",
      "certainly been known to slumber, or go below.  He would stand still\r\n",
      "for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did\r\n",
      "plainly say--We two watchmen never rest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon\r\n",
      "the deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his\r\n",
      "pivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating\r\n",
      "limits,--the main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing\r\n",
      "in the cabin-scuttle,--his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if\r\n",
      "to step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however\r\n",
      "motionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that\r\n",
      "he had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching\r\n",
      "hat, they could never tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes\r\n",
      "were really closed at times; or whether he was still intently\r\n",
      "scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a\r\n",
      "whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in\r\n",
      "beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat.  The clothes that\r\n",
      "the night had wet, the next day's sunshine dried upon him; and so,\r\n",
      "day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the\r\n",
      "planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,--breakfast\r\n",
      "and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which\r\n",
      "darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over,\r\n",
      "which still grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper\r\n",
      "verdure.  But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck;\r\n",
      "and though the Parsee's mystic watch was without intermission as his\r\n",
      "own; yet these two never seemed to speak--one man to the\r\n",
      "other--unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made\r\n",
      "it necessary.  Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the\r\n",
      "twain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like\r\n",
      "asunder.  If by day they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb\r\n",
      "men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange.\r\n",
      "At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far\r\n",
      "parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the\r\n",
      "mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the\r\n",
      "Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his\r\n",
      "abandoned substance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,\r\n",
      "and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,--Ahab\r\n",
      "seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave.  Still again\r\n",
      "both seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the\r\n",
      "lean shade siding the solid rib.  For be this Parsee what he may, all\r\n",
      "rib and keel was solid Ahab.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was\r\n",
      "heard from aft,--\"Man the mast-heads!\"--and all through the day,\r\n",
      "till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at\r\n",
      "the striking of the helmsman's bell, was heard--\"What d'ye\r\n",
      "see?--sharp! sharp!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the\r\n",
      "children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the\r\n",
      "monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity; at\r\n",
      "least, of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to\r\n",
      "doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the\r\n",
      "sight he sought.  But if these suspicions were really his, he\r\n",
      "sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his\r\n",
      "actions might seem to hint them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will have the first sight of the whale myself,\"--he said.  \"Aye!\r\n",
      "Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest\r\n",
      "of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved\r\n",
      "block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of\r\n",
      "the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a\r\n",
      "pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.  This done,\r\n",
      "with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked\r\n",
      "round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his\r\n",
      "glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah;\r\n",
      "and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate,\r\n",
      "said,--\"Take the rope, sir--I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.\"\r\n",
      "Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for them to\r\n",
      "hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope\r\n",
      "at last; and afterwards stood near it.  And thus, with one hand\r\n",
      "clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for\r\n",
      "miles and miles,--ahead, astern, this side, and that,--within the\r\n",
      "wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in\r\n",
      "the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea\r\n",
      "is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under\r\n",
      "these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in\r\n",
      "strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it.\r\n",
      "Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various\r\n",
      "different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by\r\n",
      "what is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these\r\n",
      "ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it\r\n",
      "would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant\r\n",
      "watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew\r\n",
      "be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.  So Ahab's\r\n",
      "proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing\r\n",
      "about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who\r\n",
      "had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree\r\n",
      "approaching to decision--one of those too, whose faithfulness on the\r\n",
      "look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was strange, that this\r\n",
      "was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his\r\n",
      "whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten\r\n",
      "minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly\r\n",
      "incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\r\n",
      "latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\r\n",
      "head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.  Then it darted a\r\n",
      "thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards,\r\n",
      "and went eddying again round his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\r\n",
      "not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have\r\n",
      "marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost\r\n",
      "the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in\r\n",
      "almost every sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your hat, your hat, sir!\" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who\r\n",

      "dividing them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes; the long\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin's head, removing his cap to\r\n",

      "would be king of Rome.  But only by the replacing of the cap was that\r\n",
      "omen accounted good.  Ahab's hat was never restored; the wild hawk\r\n",
      "flew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last\r\n",
      "disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute\r\n",

      "broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the\r\n",
      "shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into\r\n",
      "the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright\r\n",

      "in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of\r\n",

      "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were\r\n",

      "fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with\r\n",
      "joyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab\r\n",
      "could discover no sign in the sea.  But suddenly as he peered down\r\n",
      "and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no\r\n",
      "bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and\r\n",
      "magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly\r\n",
      "revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating\r\n",
      "up from the undiscoverable bottom.  It was Moby Dick's open mouth and\r\n",
      "scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the\r\n",
      "blue of the sea.  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like\r\n",
      "an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his\r\n",
      "steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous\r\n",
      "apparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,\r\n",
      "went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his\r\n",
      "crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\r\n",
      "its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet\r\n",
      "under water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with\r\n",
      "that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\r\n",
      "himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\r\n",
      "lengthwise beneath the boat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled\r\n",
      "for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner\r\n",
      "of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within\r\n",
      "his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high\r\n",
      "up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock.  The\r\n",
      "bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of\r\n",
      "Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the\r\n",
      "White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her\r\n",
      "mouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;\r\n",
      "but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to\r\n",
      "gain the uttermost stern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as\r\n",
      "the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and\r\n",
      "from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be\r\n",
      "darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as\r\n",
      "it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a\r\n",
      "quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac\r\n",
      "Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed\r\n",
      "him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with\r\n",
      "all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly\r\n",
      "strove to wrench it from its gripe.  As now he thus vainly strove,\r\n",
      "the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and\r\n",
      "snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,\r\n",
      "bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again\r\n",
      "in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.  These floated\r\n",
      "aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging\r\n",
      "to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them\r\n",
      "across.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the\r\n",
      "first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his\r\n",
      "head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment\r\n",
      "his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.\r\n",
      "But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over\r\n",
      "sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;\r\n",
      "spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell\r\n",
      "flat-faced upon the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\r\n",
      "distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in\r\n",
      "the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled\r\n",
      "body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or\r\n",
      "more feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their\r\n",
      "confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing\r\n",
      "their shivered spray still higher into the air.*  So, in a gale, the\r\n",
      "but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the\r\n",
      "Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.  It receives its\r\n",

      "round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his\r\n",
      "vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more\r\n",
      "deadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden\r\n",
      "him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's\r\n",
      "elephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in\r\n",

      "swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with\r\n",
      "stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod\r\n",

      "every time they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the\r\n",

      "whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently\r\n",
      "following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the\r\n",
      "banners of marching regiments in the east.  But these were the first\r\n",
      "sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had\r\n",

      "such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to\r\n",
      "the senses of the sharks--a matter sometimes well known to affect\r\n",

      "boldly to that sight?--lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and\r\n",
      "followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical\r\n",
      "third day?--For when three days flow together in one continuous\r\n",
      "intense pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the\r\n",

      "sounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on\r\n",
      "his way a little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew\r\n",

      "a subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled\r\n",
      "with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot\r\n",
      "lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.  Shrouded in a thin drooping\r\n",
      "veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then\r\n",
      "fell swamping back into the deep.  Crushed thirty feet upwards, the\r\n",
      "waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with\r\n",
      "the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last\r\n",

      "Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly\r\n",
      "mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in\r\n",
      "the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and\r\n",
      "were busily at work in repairing them.  One after the other, through\r\n",
      "the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb\r\n",
      "and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and\r\n",
      "lances.  As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken\r\n",
      "boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.  But\r\n",
      "he rallied.  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the\r\n",
      "main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that\r\n",
      "perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and\r\n",
      "so nail it to the mast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance\r\n",

      "latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White\r\n",
      "Whale's way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so\r\n",
      "rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale's last start\r\n",
      "had not been so long a one as before.  And still as Ahab glided over\r\n",
      "the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously\r\n",
      "stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that\r\n",
      "the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in\r\n",
      "the sea, at almost every dip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.  Pull\r\n",

      "round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,\r\n",
      "with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the\r\n",
      "poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the\r\n",
      "hated whale.  As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if\r\n",
      "sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically\r\n",
      "rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in\r\n",

      "elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once\r\n",
      "more have been tossed into the sea.  As it was, three of the\r\n",
      "oarsmen--who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were\r\n",
      "therefore unprepared for its effects--these were flung out; but so\r\n",
      "fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and\r\n",
      "rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily\r\n",
      "inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still\r\n",
      "afloat and swimming.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\r\n",

      "the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on\r\n",
      "their seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the\r\n",

      "wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that\r\n",
      "evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship;\r\n",
      "seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking\r\n",
      "it--it may be--a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down\r\n",
      "upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
