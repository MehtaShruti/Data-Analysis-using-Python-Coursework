### Feedback:
- Excellent work!
- Question 4: Miss a ’s’ here that is why you got 0 user in adults group.<br>

> elif "adultUser" in post.get("user"):

- Question 5: upper/lower case should be considered.
- Question 6: Merge the file first, then set words unique. Otherwise, you can not remove the same words which is redundant in two files.
