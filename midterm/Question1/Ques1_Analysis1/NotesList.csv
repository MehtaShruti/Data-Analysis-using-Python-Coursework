"""Watson, John"" <jwatson@velaw.com>",,"Mon, 11 Sep 2000 06:09:00 -0700 (PDT)","I got Goldberg's comments this morning on the term sheet with the Rockets.
there are a number of technical comments which we will make.  There are
about four substantive comments that we are working on and will review with
Tracey Ellison.  Two of the comments relate to you.  Goldberg wants to limit
seats to a maximum of 20 per Partner, not 300 total, because he said you
said at the meeting that each Partner would have a maximum of 20 seats.  I
didn't recall that any such statement by you was meant to limit the 300
seats but was merely an indication of about how many each Partner would
have.  Goldberg admitted the 300 seats was on the sheet handed out at the
meeting.  I can't believe Goldberg is continuing to haggle on this issue.  I
think we should say that the maximum of 300 seats is what the Partners
approved and be done with it.

The other issue is the amount of the referendum funding.  Goldberg said he
understood that the Rockets would match what the ""Partners"" would put up.
Alternatively he wants the right for the Rockets to raise part of their $1.5
million from others and get credit for it.  I'm not sure whether the Rockets
would interfere with you raising your balance of the $1.5 million.  In any
case I need your input on this issue both for the Rockets term sheet and
determining how much we need to get advanced on the loan from the Sports
Authority.

Subject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language

Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. ""A"" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a ""must pass"" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is ""at least 
three years away from happening.""

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.

involvement in Colombia and U.S.-South African relations.

For further information, contact the CSIS Director of Studies Office at 
202-887-0200, or reply to this e-mail.

*************************
U.S. Involvement in Colombia.

Edward Luttwak, CSIS senior fellow, says that the Colombian guerrilla groups, 
the FARC and ELN, aren't trained, aren't disciplined, and don't know how to 
shoot. How then do they control vast amounts of territory in southern 
Colombia? Because the Colombian army was never properly trained, asserts 
Luttwak. And the U.S. military is now teaching the Colombian army tactics 
that aren't appropriate for a jungle environment. Luttwak believes that the 
$1.3 billion aid package signed by Clinton to help the Colombian army is a 
mistake. Plus, whatever the United States does this year in terms of aid, it 
will have to do again next year.

Why is the United States getting involved?  The popular reason repeated on 
the Hill is to destroy the Colombian narcotics trade. Colombia contains most 
of the narcotics activity now, but that can easily move to a different 
country. The worst thing the United States could do, says Luttwak, would be 
to push the bulk of the coca production to a different Andean country in the 
""arc of fragility."" U.S. involvement also helps to mitigate the chances of 
the guerrillas overthrowing the civilian government, says Luttwak, noting 
that President Andres Pastrana's popularity is extremely low.

What then should the United States do? Luttwak's answer is to organize mobile 
training teams of people (as the United States did in El Salvador) to go into 
villages to create home guards, which would use weapons of a different 
caliber than the army. Luttwak asserts that this would work because people 
aren't divided politically at the village level. Such a solution, however, 
will not diminish narcotics trafficking.


The United States and South Africa: Drifting Apart?
The U.S.-South African relationship has undergone a significant shift, 
asserts Stephen Morrison, director of the CSIS Africa Program. The result of 
this shift is that the United States now feels that it needs South Africa 
much less than it did six years ago, while South Africa has come to value its 
relations with the United States much more than ever before.

For both countries, however, there has been a ratcheting down of 
expectations.  South African president Thabo Mbeki's May visit to Washington 
was marked by an anxiety that the next administration may reduce its contact 
with Africa. Thus, Mbeki attempted to reach out to a number of audiences-both 
the Bush and Gore camps as well as the U.S. Congress, corporate sector, and 
media. The response of the latter three was rather muted.

While the Gore-Mbeki Binational Commission proved that high-level 
intervention is essential to move forward on key issues, lacking was serious 
cooperation at the diplomatic level to respond to crises such as those in 
Congo, Angola, Zimbabwe, Sudan, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone. Plus, South Africa, 
fueled by protectionist interests, was largely ambivalent to the Africa 
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). It remains to be seen if the South African 
private sector will seize this opportunity.

Morrison says that in the future, the relationship will be evaluated 
according to the level of development of joint diplomatic initiatives in 
Zimbabwe and Congo, collaboration on the AIDS epidemic, security enhancement, 
trade and investment, and debt relief. Some form of the binational commission 
should remain in place for the next administration, warns Morrison, because 
otherwise there will be contentious wrangling over issues of trade and 
investment, international property rights, AIDS policy, and security.

 Involvement as a Potential Service Provider to Enron's EnHome Computer
 Employee Benefit Initiative","Fri, 18 Aug 2000 02:09:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken:

One of the initiatives implemented at Global Strategic Souring since its 
formation in February is to leverage Enron's aggregated purchasing power to 
facilitate commercial development opportunities for the Business (EBS, EES, 
EFS, and etc.) Units.

Annually, Enron spends several million dollars with COMPAQ for servers, desk 
top computers, and lap top computers.  COMPAQ has also been selected as one 
of the potential candidates to service the EnHome program.  COMPAQ is also 
one of EBS's alliance partners.

Given the magnitude of Enron's relationship with COMPAQ, we have formed an 
intercompany team comprised of representatives from EBS, EES, EFS, Global 
Strategic Sourcing, and the EnHome Program.  In our most recent meeting the 
business units reported the following:

COMPAQ has failed to define its requirements for EBS services under the 
current alliance agreement between the companies.  COMPAQ has also denied EBS 
access to expertise and installations required for product refinement and 
implementation.  (Based on the feedback I have received, I question whether 
COMPAQ intends to honor the terms and conditions of its relationship with 
EBS).
EFS only provides building services currently to a couple of Compaq's 
installations.  
EES has been in discussions with COMPAQ for several months now.  Although we 
are progressing, it would appear that we are at an impasse on the language in 
the contract necessary to support the transaction.
On the EnHome program, COMPAQ has generally been unresponsive to our 
questions and concerns for clarification and/or additional information on 
their experience in operating this type of program.
The Widows 2000 Roll-out Contract literally has taken months to complete when 
it should have only been a matter of weeks.

Ken, based on what I am seeing day-to-day, I am concerned that COMPAQ has 
lost sight of the value of our total business and the value of a healthy, 
bidirectional relationship.

Therefore, specifically given the unresponsiveness to our most recent 
requests for clarification on the EnHome Program and our concerns regarding 
there ability to operate a program of this magnitude, I have requested that 
we reopen discussions with IBM and DELL.

I will keep you apprised of future developments.

Rob Bradley,Thursday Meeting on Winter Gas Prices,"Tue, 12 Sep 2000 04:01:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken:

I have invited the following individuals to join us at the 3 pm Thursday 
meeting to review the draft of your Columbus speech on the natural gas 
situation.

Hamd Alhkayat--Hamd has replaced Andrew Miles in the rotation and will be 
helping me with your presentations as well as being the lead with Jeff's 
speeches.

Shelley Corman--Shelley has been developing messages for the current and 
anticipated gas situation and pipeline safety for the gas pipeline group.  
(The safety issue could come up in your Q&A.)

Stinson Gibner--Stinson is with the research group that has generated some of 
the more complex slides in your draft dealing with volatility and historic 
futures pricing.

Gil Muhl--Gil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA 
conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk.  
His group is focusing on new products to help end-users with winter 
volatility.  I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the 
meeting.

Back to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you 
today), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an 
overview of the situation as the ""teacher"" or ""professor.""  Some questions 
that you could address would include:

Where has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned?

How is the business different today?

What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history?

I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting 
before and after your keynote is that you have ""been there"" in the evolution 
of the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers 
deal with price and supply uncertainty.  There is also a good opportunity to 
stress the need for new industry ""best practices"" (more hedging) and the 
right public policies to deal with this issue (from ""do no harm"" to expanding 
incentives in the market).

             Eli Lilly and Company Launches Lillydiabetes.com
          New Web Site Designed To Help Patients Manage Diabetes

 Lillydiabetes.com is valuable resource for the 16 million Americans with
                                 diabetes


Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) has launched lillydiabetes.com (

http://www.lillydiabetes.com), an interactive Web site designed to help the

16 million Americans with diabetes and their families understand and manage

the disease and its complications.  The Web site provides patients

information about diabetes and gives them tools to help manage their

disease.



""Diabetes is a progressive, potentially debilitating disease that requires

regular monitoring of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight, among other

things,"" said Doug Rude, e-commerce team leader, Eli Lilly and Company.

""Lillydiabetes.com can help empower patients and their families with the

information and tools necessary to manage their disease and live healthier

lives.""



Lillydiabetes.com has a number of features and tools to encourage

aggressive management of diabetes.  Because diabetes is a chronic,

progressive disease, it is important that patients closely track their

progress toward better blood-sugar control, as well as the development of

diabetes-related complications. Those who register with the site have

access

to customizable ""Measures of Control"" tools designed to help patients

monitor their diabetes and the complications that can arise.  The Measures

of Control tools include:



?    HbA1c Chart (blood-sugar control) ? Hemoglobin A1c test measures
average blood-sugar levels over a two to three-month period.  Each time an
HbA1c test is done, patients can enter the value and save it as a color
graph, which then can be used to track the patient's progress toward better
blood-sugar control.
?    Height and Weight Index ? Excess body fat can lead to insulin
resistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.  This
tool helps patients calculate their body mass index, which is a measure of
body weight relative to height.  The Web site then provides a place to save
that information and chart progress toward desired weight.


?    Blood Pressure Chart ? A common complication of diabetes is high blood
pressure, which can lead to heart disease as well as signal other
potentially serious problems, such as diabetic kidney disease.  This tool
allows patients to enter their blood pressure levels, save them and chart
their progress.


Other resources found on lillydiabetes.com include:



Product Information ? With more than 75 years of innovation in diabetes

care, Eli Lilly and Company has developed many products for the treatment

of diabetes.  This section informs users about treatment options and the

latest breakthroughs.



Lilly Diabetes Today?  Newsletter ? Users can request to receive by e-mail

this newsletter, which provides information about the latest diabetes

developments and research, as well as recipe ideas and inspiring articles.



Patient Check List ? This section provides patients and family members with

a list of issues that should be addressed by their doctor, enabling them to

work with their physician to aggressively manage their disease.



Educational Resources ? Lillydiabetes.com provides information on an array

of diabetes-related topics.  Subject headings include:  About Diabetes,

Diabetes Management, Planning Meals, Diabetes Resources, and Diabetes

Products.



Lilly plans to add new tools and features to the site every 90 days.  The

new features will help equip patients, physicians and other health care

professionals with online tools that improve understanding of the disease

and delivery of care to patients.





Eli Lilly and Company

Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing

portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest

research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with

eminent scientific organizations. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind.,

Lilly provides answers ? through medicines and information ? for some of

the world's most urgent medical needs.

 Study Shows Efficacy of Zyprexa Superior to Valproate in the Treatment of
               Acute Mania Associated with Bipolar Disorder
          Study is the largest comparison of two mood stabilizers


Zyprexac (olanzapine, Lilly) provides better control of manic symptoms

during treatment of acute manic or mixed manic episodes compared with

valproate (Depakotec, Abbott), according to new data presented today at the

13th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress (ECNP) in Munich.

The study is the first head-to-head comparison of Zyprexa and valproate

since the FDA's approval of the use of Zyprexa for bipolar mania in March.



Key Findings

Dosing was based on both drugs' package inserts (see Study Design for more

information). The study's primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania

Rating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of a

patient's mania. Key study endpoint findings included:



?    The Zyprexa group experienced a significantly greater improvement on
the Y-MRS total score than did patients treated with valproate (49% vs.
38%).
?    A greater proportion of Zyprexa patients achieved remission from manic
symptoms (defined as Y-MRS Total Score < 12) compared with valproate
patients (47% vs. 34%).
?    54% of patients on Zyprexa experienced a 50% or more improvement in
Y?MRS scores compared with 42% of the valproate patients.
?    Zyprexa patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement
in certain Y-MRS Individual Item Scores compared with valproate patients:
activity/energy (53% vs. 41%), sleep (69% vs. 45%) and language-thought
disorder (49% vs. 35%).  Changes in other core symptoms of mania as defined
by the Y-MRS Individual Item Scores were similar for the two treatment
groups.




Study Design

The three-week, randomized, parallel, double-blind, acute-phase study

examined 251 hospitalized patients at 44 sites who met the DSM-IV criteria

for a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and were experiencing acute manic or

mixed episodes. Subjects received olanzapine in a flexible dose range of 5

to 20 mg/day (once daily) or valproate in a flexible does range of 500 to

2,500  mg/day (multiple doses per day). The mean ending dose for Zyprexa

was 17 mg/day and the mean ending dose for valproate was 1500 mg/day. In

addition, plasma levels were monitored to ensure valproate trough levels

were maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of 50-125 ?g/mL; the

mean value of all levels obtained was 79.4 ?g/mL. Clinicians determined

dosing based on each patient's clinical response as well as the blood

levels in patients taking valproate. Lorazepam use was restricted to a

maximum dose of 2 mg/day, and administration was prohibited within eight

hours of a psychiatric exam.



Additional Study Results

Neither Zyprexa nor valproate induced depressive symptoms in bipolar manic

or mixed patients.  In fact, both Zyprexa and valproate patients showed an

improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression

Rating Scale (HAMD-21).  However, Zyprexa patients showed greater

improvement at the study endpoint in HAMD-21 scores (35% vs. 24%).  The

effects of Zyprexa have not yet been studied in bipolar depression.



Zyprexa was generally well tolerated. The most common and significantly

different adverse events for Zyprexa were somnolence (39.2% vs. 20.6% for

valproate), dry mouth (33.6% vs. 6.3%), and increased appetite (12.0% vs.

2.4%).  The most common adverse event for valproate was nausea (28.6% vs.

10.4% for Zyprexa). Additional safety information for Zyprexa and valproate

can be obtained from their package inserts.



""These data support the value of Zyprexa as a much needed treatment

option,"" said Mauricio Tohen, M.D., Dr. P.H., medical adviser, Lilly

Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, and lead investigator for the

study.  ""The findings provide further evidence that Zyprexa effectively

stabilizes mood in patients with bipolar disorder.""



Manic symptoms occur during the manic phase of bipolar disorder, a lifelong

illness characterized by disruptive swings in mood.  Symptoms include

abnormal elation and/or irritability, often accompanied by an unrealistic

belief in one's own abilities, increased sex drive, delusions and alcohol

or drug abuse.  People with bipolar disorder also may experience mixed

episodes, marked by symptoms of mania and clinical depression occurring

simultaneously. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,

Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).  American Psychiatric Association, 1994.


Zyprexa (olanzapine, Lilly)
valproate (Depakote, Abbott)


The study findings are particularly pertinent in light of valproate's

recent revised black box warning from the Food and Drug Administration

following reports of life-threatening pancreatitis in both children and

adults.



""Physicians have good reason to take these new data into account,"" said

Carlos A. Zarate, M.D., associate professor of psychiatry and director,

bipolar and psychotic disorders program, University of Massachusetts

Medical Center.  ""The efficacy of Zyprexa coupled with its favorable safety

profile suggest that it may provide a timely treatment alternative for

patients with bipolar disorder.""



Zyprexa is indicated in the United States for the management of the

manifestations of psychotic disorders as demonstrated in short-term

clinical trials with schizophrenia patients.  It is also approved for the

short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar

disorder.



In the original schizophrenia registration trials, olanzapine was generally

well tolerated.  However, as with all medications, olanzapine was

associated with some side effects.  In the original six-week, acute-phase

schizophrenia trials, the most common treatment-emergent adverse event

associated with olanzapine was somnolence.  Other common events were

dizziness, weight gain, constipation, akathisia (restlessness), and

postural hypotension.  Modest elevations of prolactin were also seen,

although mean changes from baseline to endpoint were not statistically

significantly different between olanzapine and placebo.  A small number of

patients experienced asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminase; none

of these patients developed jaundice or drug-induced hepatitis.



In short-term (three- and four-week) acute bipolar mania trials, the most

common treatment-emergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was

somnolence.  Other common events were dry mouth, dizziness, asthenia,

constipation, dyspepsia, increased appetite, and tremor.

Subject: Update on Azurix - Buenos Aires water project

Joe
 As an update to my earlier email on the Azurix water project, Azurix has 
suspended OPIC's consideration of the project until either we are able to get 
a more positive cable out of the US Embassy in Argentina or George moves on - 
probably in late January.  
 But the OPIC pullback together with the publicity about Rebecca's departure 
has caused serious concern on the part of IDB which is now pulling back.  The 
IDB has made it clear that they are concerned about Enron's intentions 
regarding Azurix.  I have talked to Azurix about seeking some statement of 
support from Enron so that we can address this issue head on.  You may well 
be getting some communication from John Garrison on this issue.  If we can 
get back on track Azurix may be able to get IDB Board approval this fall.
 Hope you are well.  thanks John

I hope things are well with you.

I've taken on in the last year of my 6 year term the regents' chairmanship
and so I am busy working on how to help further accelerate the good things
that have occurred since we brought Art and his team to Houston.  In this
light, I read the recent article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting that
the Kuht-TV spectrum allotment includes substantial unused bandwidth which
we are legally permitted to lease to the private sector.  The Journal, based
on the recent UK auction, extrapolated the overall worth of the bandwidth at
$160 billion.  Needless to say, if we could realize a small fraction of
that, for something from which we currently derive nothing, it could be a
huge boost to our efforts to obtain the additional funding we need as we
move to Tier One status.

Since Enron is the leader in the market for bandwidth, I was hoping you or
someone at Enron could give us some advice on what we own, its value, if
any, and how we might think about realizing on any such value.  From Enron's
perspective, perhaps there is a niche market for Enron to make by helping
organize educational institutions that own such bandwidth to exploit the
value of that asset.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards.

Gene and Jim,  incredibly, and just today, I received from my previous law

me to be one of the 35  participants in the Center for Houston's Future. When 
my previous firm closed  it's Houston offices at the end of last December, 
all mail was collected and  forwarded to New York for sorting and 
redistribution. The mail from January that  should have been sent to me was 
apparently sitting in a corner all these months  in the New York mail room of 
Curtis, Mallet (my previous firm), and was  delivered to me yesterday, 
including your letter. You can imagine what my  reaction was to my previous

however, to have missed the opportunity to participate in  the Center for 
Houston's Future's endeavors, which I most certainly would have,  and am 
somewhat surprised that my failure to respond to such an important effort

 Ed Hugetz has provided the information below in response to your

Art -

This afternoon I spoke to Jeff Clarke about Gary Rosenthal's emails
regarding bandwidth.  Jeff has been in Washington this week and he had the
opportunity to talk to Todd Gray, who is our telecommunications lawyer at
Dow Lohnes.  Todd is very familiar with the Wall Street Journal article -
the writers interviewed him extensively.  He told Jeff that what was not
made clear in the article was that the class of spectrum that they were
referring to was the ITFS spectrum.  The UH System does not own any
bandwidth in this spectrum.  The broadcast spectrum that KUHT uses is in a
different class.  In the early 90's the System had the opportunity to
acquire a license for ITFS spectrum and declined.

The ITFS spectrum is a closed circuit system that covers a relatively small
radius of 10-20 miles.  It is bandwidth that is very attractive to wireless
companies, however, Todd does not think there is nearly the ""gold mine"" for
universities that own the spectrum as indicated in the article.

When Dennis Duffy returns on Monday, he and I will call Todd Gray to get
further details.

Karl Kruse <scenicmo@tranquility.net>,Save Our Scenery Campaign,"Wed, 20 Sep 2000 08:50:00 -0700 (PDT)","Dear Ken,

I spoke to Bonnie today regarding the letter I sent you on September
12th.  Bonnie suggested I follow-up that letter with this email.

With only 49 days to the election, we expect to see the oppositions'
advertisements on television and radio and in the mail in the next two
weeks.  It's crucial to our ability to be competitive that we complete
our media buys and print our next two direct mail pieces by October
1st.  If we do, we know that we can win.

Your initial contribution of $100,000 allowed us to do the first direct
mail piece to 250,000 households (a sample was included with the letter
I sent to you on the 12th).  We need to do at least two more of these
mailings for our direct mail effort to be truly effective at a total
cost of $190,000 for both (including postage).

To date, the combined total of contributions to the political campaign
and the public education campaign is just over $1,040,000.  We expect an
additional $150,000 in pledges and new contributions in the next two to
three weeks.  While we are actively soliciting others for help, we are
currently left with a shortfall of $310,000 to meet our minimum budget
of $1.5 million.  (This budget would include the production and mailing
of the three mail pieces described above)

Ken, the campaign is at a crossroads.  I cannot underscore enough how
important your additional financial help is at this time.  And, I cannot
underscore enough how important one last significant contribution from
you would be to our success on November 7th.

If you have any questions, or need additional information, please do not
hesitate to call me at (573) 446-3129 or reply to this email message.

Thank you for your past support and, hopefully, your additional
support.  Passing Proposition A is a once in a generation opportunity.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Karl","[('I', 7), ('mail', 5), ('two', 4)]"

                         4.  Is there anything else about the
drafting and presentation that you would

"""Tunley, Helen"" <helen.tunley@gs.com>",Message from Gavyn Davies re: The Global Oil Price Shock,"Thu, 21 Sep 2000 10:36:00 -0700 (PDT)","To: Ken Lay, Jeffrey Skilling and the Enron Advisory Council
From : Gavyn Davies, Goldman Sachs

Re - The Global Oil Price Shock


Since our meeting in Houston, the spike in world oil prices has gripped the
attention of financial markets. I attach a paper which analyses the genesis
of the present oil price increase, the likelihood of it proving permanent,
and the probable impact on the world economy.

The bottom line is the following:

1. The recent increase in the oil price has been due fundamentally to
an increase in global demand, and not to the activities of OPEC, operating
as an oil cartel. In fact, OPEC does not seem to have enough immediate
supply headroom to make much difference to the situation for many months.
The danger of shortages will therefore be very acute this winter, even with
normal weather conditions. This could lead to temporary spikes in the price
to well over $40/barrel. We see a similar situation, or worse, developing in
natural gas.

2. However, we do not see this situation as permanent. In terms of deep
fundamentals, the equilibrium price for oil in the long term is still only
about $18/barrel. Within about 12 months, a large increase in the supply of
oil should push prices back down again, possibly quite sharply. Our present
forecast for the average oil price in 2001 is $27/barrel, somewhat below
today's spot price levels. But we do not expect to see this oil price
downturn before next summer.

3. If oil prices do indeed average $27/bl in 2001, this will prove to
be an oil shock for the developed economies which is the same in magnitude
as the Gulf War shock a decade ago. It will reduce net disposable income for
the OECD economies by about 0.7%, and add about 0.9% to headline inflation
numbers. All of these effects will already be in the data by about 2000 Q4,
so on our main forecast there should be little or no further adverse effects
through 2001.

4. On this oil price scenario, GDP growth in the developed economies
will slow from about 3.9% in 2000 to about 3.4% in 2001 - not a bad
out-turn.

5. What if the oil price sustains $40/bl next year? This would give us
another round of effects about the same as those mentioned in para (3)
above. Even then, however, these effects should not be enough to push the
world into recession. Growth should still be adequate at about 2.5-3.0%.

6. The main risks to this conclusion are that a spike in oil prices,
and possible oil shortages, this winter cause a drop in equity prices, and a
large dip in business and consumer confidence. This could then lead to a
more pronounced downturn in GDP next year, especially if it triggers the
kind of correction in the US that Larry and I have been worrying about for a
long time. But this should prove just about avoidable, assuming sensible
policy responses..

7. This may therefore all work out a bit like the winter of 1998/99.
Going into the winter, events occur which make people worry about recession.
Business and consumer confidence, and equity markets, take a dip. But then
things improve, and it all turns out to be a buying opportunity.

8. I hope so, anyway!


Best wishes,

Gavyn

 I learned through some of the participants, that the dinner with Fox in New 
York went well.
Derbez, his economic advisor, told me that you were particularly aggressive

deregulating electricity and ""dry"" natural gas. I like that, since you 
created a great impression.

 I have been invited to join Mr. Fox on his next trip to Europe, Oct. 1-6,

In 1996, Jon Fox won his congressional race in
Pennsylvania by just a 84-vote margin out of more
than a quarter million cast.

In 1994, Sam Gejdenson won his congressional race
in Connecticut by a margin of just 21 votes.
In the 1960 presidential race, John F. Kennedy
defeated Richard Nixon by two-tenths of one
percent of the vote. That averages out to less
than one vote per precinct nationwide. Furthermore,
Kennedy would have been defeated if one more
person in each of ten Cook County (Illinois) precincts
had voted for Nixon.

Larry L Izzo,EECC INSIDE ENRON,"Thu, 21 Sep 2000 10:18:00 -0700 (PDT)","Jeff, I understand at last week's PRC you asked Dick what the difference was 
between EECC, and, say, Brown and Root.  Let me try and answer that and at 
the same time provide my recommendations on how EECC should evolve inside the 
new Enron.

a. Enron does not ""need"" EECC; however, Enron has realized extra value from 
the EECC model since 1990.

b. EECC has taken an Enron liability (construction risk) and turned it into 
an asset (net income).  The risk was incurred by Enron's decision to build 
assets around the world.

c. Enron could have out-sourced most or all of its engineering and 
construction management since 1990; but for about the same market price and 
contract value, EECC has performed this work and accumulated over $250MM of 
net income for Enron.

d. In addition, EECC has performed the work generally in a manner superior to 
the rest of the industry.  We have avoided disasters experienced by Brown and 
Root, Black and Veatch, Snamprogetti, Raytheon, and Stone and Webster, which 
presumably could have occurred while performing Enron's work.  We've out 
performed them because we had better risk management skills.  

e. Cost avoidance:  In addition to performing this work at market price and 
at the same time making $250MM net income, as Jack Urquhart pointed out at 
the last Board meeting, we have avoided tens and tens of millions of dollars 
of extra cost during execution.  The Enron portfolio of construction risks 
averages in billions of dollars, so even 1 or 2 percent in nuisance-type 
change orders from outside contractors would have added up to substantial 
extra costs. 

f. ROIC:  as we recognized the Enron deal flow was decreasing, we were asked 
in the last two to three budget cycles to maintain or grow our net income.  
Therefore, we embarked on non-Enron third-party construction business.  This 
marginal income has increased our use of working capital.  Still, this year's 
return on all our working capital will be about $22%, down from 29% last 
year, but still a 25% average over two years which is not unreasonable.  You 
asked about the details of our working capital; I'm scheduled to brief you on 
2 Oct.
 
g. Internal flexibility:  there have been many instances over the years where 
having an internal contractor has enhanced the ability of an Enron developer 
to close the deal.  For example, on the 1999 Peakers, although other 
companies have out-sourced the same type of work, I assure you that because 
of the late start getting going by the Enron developers, having to out-source 
would of easily cost us four to six weeks of summer revenues on the 
schedule.  On our current Dabhol LNG project, an outside turnkey contractor 
would never be motivated to try and maintain the current schedule, given the 
weaknesses in the Owners' contractual positions, including quarry suitability 
and subsea surface rock surprises, etc.  Many other examples abound.

h. Downsizing risks:  I think the risk to Enron of what happens to a large 
EECC in the event of downsizing during a market cycle is misconceived.  EECC 
in Houston has about 350 employees, many of whom are accountants, lawyers, 
contract specialists, program managers,  all of whom have skill sets which 
are in demand in other Enron business units.  Therefore, any downsizing of 
EECC, if done over a reasonable period of time should be able to avoid a 
significant severance cost risk.

Nevertheless, as Enron changes to a less-asset dependent company, and because 
of the current value in monetizing assets, the need for change is necessary.  
I think it is important to agree on a clear plan and brief our employees, all 
of whom are stressed by the uncertainty of where they're going.  This will 
have a negative impact on the company's performance, unless addressed.

My recommendations for evolving EECC is as follows:

a. Sell NEPCO and phase out other non-Enron third-party lump sum work 
(already on-going).

b. Define a ""slice"" of EECC in Houston as ""NEPCO-Houston,"" and package this 
with the NEPCO sell.  A buyer might value the EECC-Houston expertise in 
cogeneration and gas-related services.

c. Finish the Enron work now under contract, which will take from one to two 
years.

d. Continue to self-perform any new Enron work in the future which I see 
centered in North America, Europe and possibly Brazil where assets may be 
required to enhance the Enron networks being developed for trading purposes.  
I think it would be a mistake to allow the decentralized business units to 
attempt to manage outside EPC contractors without a residual Center of 
Excellence (EECC).

e. Move EECC inside EES, allowing EES to take advantage of a continued income 
stream from EECC.  A subsequent step would be to merge the infrastructure 
between EES' Global Services and EECC.

f. Slowly downsize the company as the current work evolves and the work load 
permits.

g. Continue to develop engineering services for customers, without taking 
construction risks, but taking advantage of our reputation for due diligence 
and risk mitigation.  I think this effort could fit well inside EES as 
another service provided by Enron.

h. Continue EECC's initiative to develop an E-commerce revenue stream, 
currently being undertaken in coordination with Enron Networks, but relying 
on EECC's intellectual capital, lessons learned and contacts in the 
industry.  I think we have good potential for this opportunity, which is 
actively underway.

In summary, EECC's assets are the intellectual capital of its people and the 
collective systems and procedures it has developed.  Both can continue to 
provide value to Enron inside EES.  I've been discussing details with Lou and 
Joe, but I strongly recommend we agree on a clearly defined plan and allow me 
to communicate it to our employees.

New Radio Ad Slams Corzine Dishonesty 
Surrounding Questionable Financial Dealings

Washington, DC -- Calling the campaign of liberal New Jersey Democrat Senate 
candidate Jon Corzine, ""a cynical and manipulative effort to deceive New 
Jersey voters about Corzine's questionable and mysterious financial 
dealings,"" Mark Miller, Executive Director of the Republican Leadership 
Council (RLC) announced the release of a new radio ad that begins airing this 
morning throughout New Jersey. 

The text of the 60-second radio ad, entitled ""Dodge,"" is as follows: 

Announcer: 

Money can buy multi-millionaire Jon Corzine a lot, but it can't buy New 
Jersey's trust... he must earn it.? And that's a problem for Jon Corzine. 
? 
According to recent news reports, Jon Corzine is having trouble with the 
truth. 

Corzine and his supporters were asked if Jon Corzine had contributed to their 
organizations prior to receiving their political endorsements.? The answer 
was ""no"". 

Now, Corzine's own records indicate his foundation did give one of the groups 
a contribution.? Corzine responded that the contribution came before he 
announced his candidacy.? But Corzine's own records revealed that he made the 
contribution after he announced his candidacy.? Corzine said the tax exempt 
contribution was for an after school program.? But the group's leader said 
that Corzine knew the contribution was for a political office. 

Call Jon Corzine at 973/643-0500.? Tell him trust is something money can't 
buy.? Paid for by the Republican Leadership Council. 

?Said Miller: ""Jon Corzine has created his own campaign problems by 
continuing to shroud his financial past in secrecy.? Mr. Corzine's vast 
wealth has allowed him to buy a record number of slick political ads, but if 
he thinks he can simply purchase the trust of New Jerseyans, he's in for a 
very unpleasant surprise.""

Subject: Vice President Recommendation

 I am recommending Linda Robertson (currently Assistant Secretary for the 
Department of the Treasury) for the position Vice President and General 
Manager of Federal Government Affairs.  Linda would head our Washington, D.C. 
office, replacing Joe Hillings who will be retiring early next year.

 Linda has interviewed with Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff 
Shankman, who join me in this recommendation.

 Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal 
article identifying Linda among the ""Washington 100"".

 We have conducted extensive reference checks on Linda.  Included among those 
was Secretary Summers who said:

""Nobody I know has the determination she has to get objectives met.""
""Far more capacity to grasp the details than anyone I've seen.""

 On Monday, I will seek Executive Committee approval to extend the offer to 
Linda.

Mr. Sutton-

You are a professed champion for what Enron is about, so I would like to make 
a comment regarding the new commercial for the weather products desks.

I think it is in extremely poor taste to have an effigy of a CEO shot in a 
shooting gallery. I think most decent people would agree with me here.

What are we saying? What are we saying Enron is all about? Are we really a 
dark and Orwellian ship?

There has been a lot of emphasis placed on becoming more sensitive, as a 
society, to the issue of gun violence.

Enron comes off demonic in this commercial, much like Nike comes off as 
satanic in their chainsaw commercial which NBC pulled.

Perhaps this is all a  publicity stunt, where we have CNBC refuse to run the 
ad and then generate an exponential increase in the publicity we receive. 
That would be clever. If not, I would ask you to reconsider the decency of 
the ad, and to ask the Executive Committee how a group of decnet people could 
design such an ad.

Sincerely,

Clayton Vernon

Subject: Selection Of My Successor-My Concern

Ken: I have ""heard"" from two sources in this office that Enron will announce 
my successor today. I have not been advised of the selection and am concerned 
that this announcement will not treat my retirement in an appropriate and 
deserving manner.

I have placed calls to Steve Kean since hearing this rumor but have not 
received a response as of now. Admittedl, our phone service because of the 
office construction is not totally functioning.

Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have 
been acccused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is 
untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status 
than I have been.

I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total 
cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with 
the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves.

office this morning who advised that my successor (Linda) was to be announced 
today. I thought I had a committment from you and Rick that the people in 
this office would meet the final candidates and make input before a final 
decision was made.

The rumors have been very active throughout this process and people in this 
office have been aware of the various candidates. I have gained 98 percent of 
my information from my office collegues. I have not been discussing any of 
these matters with outsiders suggesting that they contact Nils for any 
information.

Naturally, I am concerned how this announcement is to be made because I am 
hoping to have a life after Enron possibly a position in a future 
administration. I have had a very successful tenure from the standpoint of 
accomplishments and establishing the groundwork for additional success which 
my successor will have the benefit. Therefore, I want a very positive 
statement made about my service with a Ken Lay quote.

Mark Palmer,Re: new commercial,"Mon, 25 Sep 2000 04:55:00 -0700 (PDT)","Joe,

Here's a possibility.  Let me know what you think.

Dear Clayton,

Thanks for your note about our new television ad.  Our goal with the ad 
campaign is to increase Enron's familiarity and favorability with business 
and government opinion leaders.  We want to do that by communicating the 
innovative culture at Enron that always asks the question, ""Why?""  When we 
heard businesses blaming poor financial performance on their inability to 
manage weather risks, we asked, ""Why?""  We answered that with our weather 
derivatives product that helps companies protect revenues from unfavorable 
weather.  Now, many equity analysts and other investors are challenging 
companies that don't use weather derivatives as a risk management tool.

In order to get our message across in a cluttered advertising environment, we 
need to create compelling images to get that message accross.  The use of a 
traditional symbol (the old cork gun shooting gallery) applied in a 
non-traditional way (shooting down conventional wisdom) gets the point across 
very directly that traditional excuses don't ""stand up"" to today's markets.  
I think it's a powerful, and humorous, symbolic message.

I'm sorry if you're taking the reference to an old-fashioned game literally.  
I can assure you that no ducks or CEOs were harmed in the making of the 
commercial.  

Sincerely,

Joe Sutton

I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
the partners to the referendum campaign.

Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
procedure with Sue Walden.

With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum
campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action
committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the
general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of
these laws provides that ""a person may not knowingly make or authorize a
political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the
person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the
person actually making the contribution . . . .""   Pending a better
understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the
partnership's account.

Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have

Maureen McVicker,"Talking Points re ""reregulation"" in California","Mon, 14 Aug 2000 10:42:00 -0700 (PDT)","As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some 
talking points for your use.

Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.

In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new 
capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by 
proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, 
has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not 
deregulation.

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of 
Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded 
where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX (i.e. the spot market).

In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  
Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time 
for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market 
responds.

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation.  Policy makers should:

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed.

Expedite interconnection of new generation.

Expedite siting of new facilities.

Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions.


Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff 
Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

BROWN_MARY_JO@LILLY.COM,Lilly Press Release,"Thu, 28 Sep 2000 11:07:00 -0700 (PDT)","     RPI TO INITIATE PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS ON ANTI-HEPATITIS C DRUG

BOULDER,  Colorado  -  September  28,  2000: Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(RPI)  (NASDAQ:RZYM)  today announced that it has repurchased its rights to
Heptazyme?  from  Eli Lilly and Company and will initiate Phase II clinical
trials  as  soon  as  possible  for  the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to study
dose-ranging  and  biological  markers  of  the  drug's efficacy in chronic
Hepatitis C patients.

Earlier  this month, RPI and Eli Lilly and Company completed a 28 day study
of Heptazyme (LY466700) following daily subcutaneous injections that showed
successful  safety,  tolerability  and pharmacokinetics.  The next phase of
clinical trials will examine the safety and efficacy of Heptazyme alone, at
higher  doses  than  used  in  previous  studies,  and  in combination with
interferon,  a  current  treatment  for  patients  with  Hepatitis C  virus
infection.

Lilly has directed the clinical trials for the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to
date   under   a   licensing   agreement  between  the  parties.   Ribozyme
Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  has now renegotiated the global rights to Heptazyme
and  will  direct  all  subsequent  clinical trials.  The Phase II trial is
expected to begin in the first quarter of 2001.

""We  are  pleased  to  be  able  to repurchase Heptazyme rights and to have
resources  to  develop  it aggressively,"" said Ralph E. Christoffersen, CEO
and  President  of RPI.  ""We are committed to address the need for improved
therapies  for  HCV,  and  plan  to  move forward as quickly as feasible in
Heptazyme's development.""

Ribozymes   are  the  product  of  Nobel  Prize  winning  science  and  are
synthetically engineered to act as ""molecular scissors"" capable of cleaving
target RNA in a highly specific manner.

RPI (www.rpi.com), located in Boulder, Colorado, is the acknowledged leader
in ribozyme therapeutic development.  RPI has recently announced a ribozyme
commercial  development  program  to develop a ribozyme therapeutic against
Hepatitis  B.  RPI is partnered with Chiron Corporation for the development
and  commercialization  of ANGIOZYME?, an anti-angiogenic ribozyme designed
to  inhibit  the  growth  of new blood supplies to tumors and prevent tumor
growth  and  metastasis.   ANGIOZYME  is  in  Phase I/II clinical trials in
cancer  patients  at  the  Cleveland Clinic.  RPI is also partnered with an
affiliate  of Elan Corporation plc for development and commercialization of
HERZYME?, an anti-HER-2 ribozyme for treatment of breast and other cancers,
through RPI's subsidiary Medizyme Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

RPI  will  have  a Live Webcast regarding this information today at 3:00 pm
MDT.  This webcast can be accessed through the RPI website (www.rpi.com) in
the Investor Relations section.

Chris Thrall,Regenesys,"Fri, 29 Sep 2000 09:06:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken and Mark,

Richard Lewis mentioned to me that you had recently read an article about 
Regenesys, the large-scale battery technology being developed in the UK, and 
wanted to know more about Enron's potential interest in this technology.  I 
am a Manager in our UK Origination and have tracked the progress of Regenesys 
since it first came on the scene over one year ago.  We have watched it with 
interest given the historical peak/off-peak spread in this country's power 
market.  Bruce Stram and I have also co-ordinated our efforts on the 
preliminary analysis.

Below is a brief summary of Regenesys, our initial views on the technology 
and our response going forward.

Technology Summary
large-scale battery system using two oppositely-charged electrolytes that are 
separated by an ion exchange membrane
current generating plant capacity up to 14.75 MW per unit (or 120 MWh per day)
response time within 20 milliseconds
it can release full power within a few seconds thereby yielding brief 
capacity of up to 500 MW
$1500 / kW capital costs initially which are expected to decrease to approx. 
$750 / kW 
18 month build time for facility which requires a site of just under 1 
hectare (50 m x 60 m)


Latest Developments
Innogy announced last month that it will proceed with it's first Regenesys 
plant at Aberthaw Power Station in the UK
Tennessee Valley Authority has just signed some form of agreement with Innogy 
on the Regenesys technology but there are no firm decisions to build a unit 
there yet

Our Cynical Point of View
Innogy have got to go a long way before they can make this technology 
commercially successful
Our initial analysis shows that based on the peak/off-peak spreads they need 
to achieve capital costs less than $600 / kW to be successful - we have not 
seen evidence that this can be achieved
Innogy have been hyping up the technology in the past month to support the 
forthcoming spilt of National Power and to prepare for a potential floatation
There has been a flurry of press releases and news articles recently yet the 
specifications of the technology (including capital cost) have not improved 
since we first looked at this in July 1999
Innogy touts this as a revolution in energy storage for peak/off-peak 
arbitrage, however, commercially it does not compare to having large-scale 
diesel standby generation

On the Brighter Side
The real potential for this technology could be in supporting grid systems 
It has good black start and frequency response capabilities

Way Forward
We are evaluating the commercial attraction of the black start and frequency 
response characteristics with respect to our interests in the UK
I will continue to liaise with Bruce Stram in evaluating any further 
potential in the US

Please let me know if you would like any further details on the above.

Regards,

Chris","[('technology', 8), ('Regenesys', 5), ('Innogy', 5)]"

I am writing to confirm our discussion of yesterday afternoon.  After we
spoke, I conferred with John Watson who, like me, believed that we were
going to use terms of the Enron Field financing for the Arena, with a few
minor changes that we had discussed.  The term sheet that we originally
provided you during the summer reflected that arrangement.  We have
discussed that term sheet with the partners, believing it to be the deal,
and they have approved the garage loan on those terms.

John and I believe that the comments on the term sheet that you, James
Hernandez and Mike Bartolotta have provided us recently constitute a
significant departure from the Enron Field deal.  Although we understand the
arguments each of you have made in favor of such comments, these comments
nonetheless will need to be evaluated by a business representative from the
partnership and approved by the partnership.  I recommend that we schedule a
meeting next week so that we can discuss these issues and try to resolve
them.

Finally, John was disappointed to hear that the HCHSA will be unwilling to
prepay the $1.4 million amount needed by the referendum.  Because we
understand that the referendum campaign is in dire need of funding, we hope
that you might reconsider your decision not to prepay the $1.4 million until
after we have finalized the term sheet.

I will be unavailable for a great deal of the day today, but I will have
time to meet next week.  Please let me know when we might be able to get
together to discuss the term sheet.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle","[('I', 6), ('term', 5), ('sheet', 5)]"

PASS THIS ON TILL IT REACHES EVERYONE BY ELECTION TIME

Our Senators and Congressmen don't pay in to Social Security, and, of
course, they don't collect from it.The reason is that they have a
special retirement plan that they voted for themselves many years ago.
For all practical purposes, it works like this:

When they retire, they continue to draw their same pay, until they die,
except that it may be increased from time to time, by cost of living
adjustments. For instance, former Senator Bradley, and his wife, may be
expected to draw $7,900,000, with Mrs.. Bradley drawing $275,000 during
the last year of her life. This is calculated on an average life span
for each. This would be well and good, except that they paid nothing in
on any kind of retirement, and neither does any other Senator or
Congressman.

This fine
retirement comes right out of the General Fund: our tax money. While we
who pay for it all, draw an average of $1000/month from Social Security.
Imagine for a moment that you could structure a retirement plan so
desirable that people would have extra deducted so that they could
increase their own personal retirement income. A retirement plan that
works so well, that  Railroad employees, Postal Workers, and others who
aren't in it, would clamor to get in. That is how good Social Security
could be, if only one small change were made. That change is to jerk the
Golden Fleece retirement out from under the Senators and Congressmen,
and put them in Social Security with the rest of us. Then watch how fast
they fix it. If enough people receive this, maybe one or some of them
along the way,  might be able to help.

How many can YOU send it to ??

"""Telle, Michael S."" <mtelle@velaw.com>",Referendum Campaign,"Mon, 2 Oct 2000 03:18:00 -0700 (PDT)","Mr. Lay--

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at

"""Garten, Jeffrey"" <jeffrey.garten@yale.edu>",Panel on Valuation,"Mon, 2 Oct 2000 09:07:00 -0700 (PDT)","Dear Ken,

I'd like to thank you for your continued participation in this project.

I thought it would make sense to quickly recap where we are following last
week's meeting.

1. We will redraft the report to reflect several trains of thought.  We
will, for example, express a greater appreciation for the fact that there
are major problems with the current financial reporting framework, a big gap
between GAAP and the real world in which investors must make their
judgements.  We will devote much more attention to the issue of intangibles,
including the need for a common language to describe them.  We will
elaborate on the issue of the environment for disclosure, suggesting that we
need a way of thinking about the concept of safe harbor, one which is based
on the notion that the way to protect investors amid so much uncertainty is
to make it easier for companies to provide forward looking information,
knowing that no one can be fully confident of any projections these days.
We will be much bolder in recommending several groups - the SEC, FASB,
institutional investors - take a much greater interest in the deficiencies
of the reporting model and ask the questions, commission the studies, etc.

All of this will still be within the framework of the spirit of the last
draft - that is, we're against more regulation at this time, against
prescriptive one-size-fits-all mandates, etc.  And we believe that the
market is forcing disclosure already - but maybe not quickly or
comprehensively enough.

2. Some of the panel members will have supplementary views.  Can you
begin to put pen to paper now?  Here is my speculation as to who may want to
say what:

* Len Baker and Rob Glaser may wish to write something on the recent
""Fair Disclosure"" decision.  I sense that Dennis Powell might wish to join.
Len, can you take the lead?  I'd suggest no more than one page, preferably
half a page.

* John Neff may wish to express skepticism about the value of
developing a new language for intangibles.

* John Doerr and Len Baker may wish to say something about accounting
for pooling or stock options.  Again, please keep it very short.  John, can
you take the lead?

If anyone else is thinking about a supplementary view, please let me know.
We would appreciate these submissions by October 15.

3. Future Schedule.  We agreed to ""get it right"" and not to stop until
we do.   The next steps, it seems to me are:

* Get you a new draft
* Get your views either in a meeting or conference call to be
scheduled
* See where we are then

However, I'd like to suggest that we aim to finish this report by December
15, 2000 if at all possible.

Please let me know if I've missed anything or if you have additional ideas.

Best regards,
Jeff

BROWN_MARY_JO@LILLY.COM,Transactions in Lilly Stock,"Mon, 2 Oct 2000 09:24:00 -0700 (PDT)","This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these ""black-outs"" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of ""inside
   information"" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in September, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Rudy Socha <kelly@erienet.net>,Ken - would you help us?,"Tue, 3 Oct 2000 05:19:00 -0700 (PDT)","We need a utility/energy company referral.

We are an early stage e-commerce company that offers the
world's largest selection of wildlife merchandise. We are ready
to obtain our first round of financing.  We would like
to have 5 co-branding partners who would receive equity positions in
our company.  We would incorporate their logo throughout our site and
include their PR materials with each order shipped.  Target partners
would include the utility and energy companies.  Since your
company is active in this market, you may know of someone who can assist
us.

We see utility/energy companies as a compatable fit because of their
interest in projecting a positive wildlife/environmental image.

About our company:

WildlifeCollectibles.Com is a specialty catalog company featuring
wildlife merchandise.  We have the world's largest selection of wildlife
merchandise.  Currently in the wildlife merchandise niche
there are no entities offering broad merchandise selections for each
animal specie.  We are filling this void by operating 22 ""sub-niche""
stores under the WildlifeCollectibles.Com brand.  These 22 storefronts
will represent 105 wildlife species.  Seven of these storefronts are
operational and the backend inventory systems are complete for the other
15.  We are in the process of loading them on the Internet.

One major component not yet installed on our site is our ""Facts About
the Specie"" page.  We will have reference information available for
every wildlife specie listed on our site.  At present,
there is no central repository of reference material available for most
species.  Britanica.com has reference information available for only 11
species.  This will attract school age children with their parents
tagging along.

We are looking for a total of 5 million dollars.  In order to assist
companies in purchasing an equity position/co-branded arrangement with
us, we are willing to finance their investment.  We will take $25,000.00
a month for 40 months from 5 corporate partners.  This will allow them
to budget the expense through Public Relations or Marketing.

I hope I have given you enough information to understand what
we would like to do, so you can either assist us or point us in the
right direction.  We would pay a commission and provide a small equity
stake in our company to the individual who signs on the utility/energy
companies for us.

		 Subject: i2 NETWORK DEAL IS SIGNED !

Hello --

We have i2's signature on the VBN network contract.  The contract is a 3-year 
VBN deal covering certain i2 locations in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and India.  
The TCV of the deal is $14.8 million.

This is one of the first major external VBN deals for Enron and has been 
instrumental in shaping the VBN offering.  It also brings an anchor network 
client to our Tokyo and India sites.  The interactions with i2 on this 
agreement have also contributed to our understanding of which BOS features 
are most desired by customers.

The i2 deal is the result of a lot of hard work and persistence by a number 
of folks throughout EBS and other Enron groups.  Just about everyone in EBS' 
Technology Channels Group contributed to the i2/Enron relationship that 
culminated in the network deal.  Particular thanks to Mike Haney who led the 
team through multiple iterations of the deal structure.  Special thanks to 
David Berberian, Erin Wesling, and Brad Harris who spent lots of time on the 
contract and the network design work with i2.  Thanks also to LaRence 
Snowden, Tony Gilmore, and Beaven Fernandez of TDS, Steve McCarrel of Legal, 
Wayne Gardner of Tax, and Laura Leibman of Regulatory who helped throughout 
the course of the deal structuring and to  Everett Plante, Larry Ciscon, and 
Kenny Burroughs and their teams who provided input on BOS and network 
topics.  In addition, thanks to the Enron India team who supported the deal 
throughout the design and negotiation process.

i2 has remarked often on the professionalism and collaborative spirit of the 
Enron team throughout this process.  Enron is now i2's preferred network 
provider, and we are poised to provide the rest of i2's data network 
worldwide as soon as the design specifications are completed by i2.  Thanks 
again to the entire team on your success.  Best regards.

Not knowing the correct department or individual to write to I am forwarding 
my comments to you knowing they will get directed to the correct team. 

I just completed watching the Enron All Employee Meeting you hosted in 
Houston on my PC in my office. What a fantastic way to conduct a meeting. I 
was able to listen while I worked, stopping only when a particular subject 
aroused my attention. And being able to see the slide presentation at the 
same time was so much better than  trying to read that little type from a 
long distance over a sea of heads that keep bobbing. 

The only problem I experienced was a cutting out of the audio signal. Once a 
situation like this is resolved I believe Enron may have found the ideal 
solution to communicate to all their employees in a less costly and time 
consuming method than the standard meeting. 

Thanks for taking my comments.

John Sherriff,Atlantic Copper/Freeport McMoran,"Tue, 3 Oct 2000 11:05:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken

I mentioned in a voicemail today that you should be receiving a phone call 
from James (Jimbo) Moffet (504) 582-4000.  He is Chairman of Freeport McMahon 
in New Orleans.  James had mentioned to Thomas Boettcher & Michael Hutchinson 
in our Metals group that he knew you and wanted to make sure you were 
supportive of our discussions with them.  Here is the background on a 
possible acquisition that we have brought up with them:

            Enron Metals is very interested in pursuing further discussions 
with Atlantic Copper on the acquisition of their smelter in Spain.  Estimated 
capital would be US$350 Million.  Acquiring this asset gives us the 
opportunity to build copper and copper concentrate positions and more 
effectively managing our positions in the market place. We would finance this 
off balance sheet.

 Mr. James Targetta, head of Atlantic Copper (copper smelter and refinery in 
Spain and fully owned by Freeport McMoran) had a conversation with James 
Moffet, Chairman of Freeport McMoran last Friday informing him about our 
preliminary conversations.   Moffet advised Targetta not to proceed further 
until he speaks to you since he has known you for 25 years.  

 In addition, Targetta mentioned the possibility for Enron purchasing all the 
copper mining activities of  Freeport McMoran which would leave them as an 
oil and exploration company.

We think there are some great possibilities here.    

If you have not heard from him in the next few days, I would really 
appreciate you giving Moffet a call.   I would be more than happy to get a 
more extensive briefing for you if you think you need it.   I look forward to 
discussing this further with you.

I wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting. It was 
this:

The Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and 
received free air time of ""Enron"" on the news. With NASCAR being as popular 
as it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't Enron 
sponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors? 
Enron is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel, 
energy, and the most powerful being the victor?

Now with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as 
AOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race 
would provide more airtime of the Enron logo and further placement of ""The 
New Power Company"" in the retail consumer/viewer's venue. It would also give 
me someone to ""root"" for.

Dear Dr. Ken Lay, Mr. Jeff Skilling and Mr.Ken Rice,

Thank you very much for meeting us on October 13.
I think Ronnie has already left you a brief message about eAccess. Let me
fill you in with some more background information about us.
I am the founder of DDI (the second largest wireline and wireless private
telecom operator in Japan). Today's DDI market capitalization is around $20
billion. I left DDI at the end of 1995 and became a professor and Keio
University Business School for 4 years. I have also been an active member in
the government telecom deregulation committee. I left Keio University last
year and founded eAccess in November 1999. With less than one year in
operation, eAccess has already established a strong presence in the Japanese
telecom market. We have three phases in our long-term business plan, (1)
broadband access network; (2) CSP and ASP streaming related business; (3) IP
metropolitan backbone infrastructure business. As we are currently looking
for the best global strategic partner to achieve the goal together, we
believe that Enron could become a strong potential partner in Japan.

If you need any more information about eAccess, please do not hesitate to
call or email me.
I am looking forward to seeing you on October 13.

Regards

Dr. Sachio Semmoto

Re George W. Bush Debate Win/Al Gore's Lies

I hope you got a chance to see the debate last night.  George W. Bush did a
very good job articulating his message and debating Al Gore.

I am sure it will come as no surprise to you that Al Gore could not go the
entire debate without telling a lie.  In fact, two lies have been exposed so
far.

The first one was Gore's claim that he visited Texas with FEMA Director,
James Lee Witt, after the bad Texas floods and tornadoes.  As it turns out,
that was a lie.  Al Gore on the morning news shows today claimed that he
thought he had, but it must have been another state.  Go figure.

The next lie exposed is as follows:

News radio 970 WFLA interviewed the principal of Sarasota High this morning.
He said that the girl that Gore was talking about had no desk for exactly
one day.  It was the first day of class and they were still making
adjustments to the kids class schedule and that particular classroom was
being refurbished.  The teacher only had to call the office and get her a
desk because they have plenty of desks there.  Apparently there is a picture
that was sent to Gore of her standing in class or something like that
because the Principal mentions that in the picture of her there is $100,000
of new equipment behind her.

Please pass this along to your friends and family and any undecided voters.
The more people who realize that Al Gore is a pathological liar, the better
George W. Bush will do.

Please check out the two links and cast your vote for George W. Bush as the
winner in last night's debate:  http://news.excite.com/news/poll/ or
http://www.cnn.com/

Last but not least....Have you done everything you can do to elect George W.
Bush?  Have you made a small contribution to Victory 2000?  Have you
participated in a literature drop for the GOP Ticket or made phone calls on
its behalf?  If not, please let me know.

Thanks for your support.

"""Kiechel, Walter"" <wkiechel@hbsp.harvard.edu>",A Harvard conference,"Wed, 4 Oct 2000 07:51:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken, we met a while back--'94 or so--when I was editor of Fortune. It's in
my current incarnation, though, as Editorial Director for the Harvard
Business School Publishing Co. and head of its publishing division--we
publish the Harvard Business Review, HBS Press books (including Leading the
Revolution from your friend and skiing companion Gary Hamel), and the best
selling management newsletter in the country, among other things--that I
wanted to put a proposition before you to see if we might interest you in
what I think may be an important idea-development and publishing
opportunity.
HBSPC has become quite interested in the subject of corporate venturing, of
how companies can invest in innovation and new organizational forms (but you
know all about that) in a transformative way, so much so that we're planning
to put on a couple of conferences on the subject next year. (The purpose of
our conferences, in general, is to push ideas ahead and advance the thinking
on a particular topic.) They will be smallish, half-day affairs--we're
looking at an audience of perhaps 75 senior executives at each--one in New
York in January, the second in San Francisco, probably the first week in
February. As with the authors of the books and HBR articles that we publish,
we're committed to having only top-flight experts on the program, mostly on
panels. (For instance, we're talking with the Harvard Business School
professors who teach the executive education course on corporate venturing
about their serving on and putting together one of the panels.) And we, of
course, thought of you and Enron--who knows more about the subject? As we've
designed the conferences, we've concluded that a great way to begin the
program would be to have a sort of a keynote from a CEO grounded in the
real-world experience of making this happen. But we don't want to impose on
your time, or that of your staff, to put together a speech. Our thought was
to have the session be more like ""A conversation with..."", wherein an
interlocutor (probably me, but maybe assisted by a couple of others) would
put questions to you, and draw you out on the points you thought important.
We could confer on the questions beforehand as much or little as you'd like.
Ken Chenault of American Express has agreed to play this role at the New
York conference. We'd wondered if there were any possibility of interesting
you in it for the San Francisco conference? Enron has the best record of any
company on this front, and my secret hope is that the conversation might
serve as the basis of an article (or even the first step toward a book?)
that HBSP might eventually publish. We know, too, that you have endless
demands on your time, and if it would help you to think more favorably of
using it in this way, we'd be happy to provide an honararium for the charity
or charities of your choice.
I'm sure you're besieged with emails on your return from vacation,  but if
you have a moment to marinate on this, we'd welcome the chance to answer any
questions you might have about the event. I have two offices and two phone
numbers (New York, Monday, Tuesday, and most Fridays, at 212-872-9281,
Boston the rest of the week at 617-783-7535) but the most efficient way for
your office to schedule a conversation might be to have them be in touch
with Maria Carnevale here in New York at 212-872-9285) or just shoot me back
an email.
Thanks for taking the time for this overlong email. Our eyes are beginning
to open here to the landscape shaking, transformative possibilities of
corporate venturing, as became clear to you long ago. We'd be grateful for
the opportunity to help you share some of your wisdom with others.
All the best,
Walter Kiechel

I have received an e-mail from Sherri, confirming our
forthcoming meeting with Messrs. Skilling and Rice at
9:00 am, October 13th in Mr. Skilling's office in Houston.

 I, our COO, Eric Gan and our CTO, Yoshihiro Obata will be there
to explore the possibility of potential strategic alliance between
Enron and eAccess in IP/telecom business in Japan.

In spite of such a short notice,  I deeply appreciate your
generosity to accept us with the introduction of my friend,
Mr. Ronnie Chan who is serving your board.  When you
have a chance to see him very soon in Florida, please
send my best regards to him.

I will be in Houston all day on Wednesday, Oct. 25 en route to Monterrey for
a Board Meeting on Oct. 26 and thought of how long it has been since we last
met.

If there is any chance you could fit me into your busy schedule for 15
minutes, I would be very appreciative.  As you may recall, I now manage
Darby - the emerging markets investment firm created by Nick F. Brady in
1994.

We have launched a number of new investment vehicles for Latin America.  Our
Latin American Mezzanine Fund aimed at helping finance infrastructure
projects is still the only one of its kind in the Region.  There should be
some interesting opportunities for Enron and Darby to work together.

I look forward to hearing from you.

My interests are primarily business development.  Although an engineer by
training, I have been in the business and operations side for the last 20
years.  My main area has been natural resources and energy.  I also enjoy
strategy work, and apparently am good at it, judging by the results from the
international plan I did as the first ever VP, International at Westcoast
Energy.

> One item of note regarding project feasibility - while I ran Westcoast

The attached one pager describes an embryonic idea for a new philanthropy 
venture that might be of interest for your panel discussion with Michael Dell 
at the Fortune conference on October 12th.

It is inspired by the populist arguments on the campaign trail against 
partial social security privatization.  I believe that if a greater number of 
Americans were corporate investors there would be a greater buy in to not 
only social security reform but to sound economic policies.  I also believe 
that redistributionist arguments would carry less weight.

I want to advise you that as of this Monday, Aug. 28, CNBC will begin
displaying all quotes and price changes in decimals (dollars and cents)
instead of fractions.

As you know, the securities industry as a whole is headed towards decimal -
based pricing.  Both the NYSE and the NASDAQ plan to gradually change over
to decimals to comply with the SEC's mandate of total decimal conversion by
April 9, 2001.  By making the full move to decimals all at once, we are
preparing CNBC viewers for this eventual industry-wide changeover.

I welcome any comments from you or others in your organization about these
changes or other aspects of CNBC coverage.   Please let me know if you would
like to be removed from our ongoing notification list or add others in your
organization.

Enron Public Affairs has launched a new initiative: ENRON  UNIVERSITY  
AFFAIRS.  The overall mission of Enron University Affairs is to broaden the 
depth and scope of our relationships with targeted universities through 
building Enron brand recognition on campuses, leveraging research exchanges 
of intellectual capital between Enron and the Academic community, and 
enhancing commercial opportunities for Enron.  Additionally, this initiative 
will further Enron's efforts to hire and retain the world's most innovative 
employees.

I am leading this initiative, as Vice President, joined by Mike Rosen as a 
Director. Cindy Derecskey will also work with our team in conjunction with 
her position as public affairs coordinator.

Currently, Harvard Business School is developing a case study ""to capture the 
evolution of Enron's business model and the underlying entrepeneurial 
culture, which made that evolution possible"". A significant part of the 
research centers on how Enron manages its intellectual capital. 
Harvard Professor Christopher Bartlett, Daewoo Professor of Business 
Administration and Chair, Program for Global Leadership, is leading this 
effort, assisted by Meg Wozny, his research associate at Harvard Business 
School.  Professor Bartlett and Ms. Wozny have already co-written case 
studies on General Electric and Microsoft.

Jeff Skilling has already met/interviewed with Professor  Bartlett  and Ms. 
Wozny, along with several other Enron Management members.

Cindy , Tom,  Andy,  Gene,  Mark  and  Rick, we are trying to schedule one 
hour meetings with each of you Wednesday, October 11th,  Thursday October 
12th, or Friday  October 13th.

Please  reply with your preferred 1 hour time slot asap.

Please reply to me by e-mail or phone/voice mail   @ 3-6117.

Additional information regarding the work, Enron management already involved,

Hi Christie:

Prof. Bartlett and I would like to capture the evolution of Enron's
business model and the underlying entrepreneurial culture, which made that
evolution possible.  A big part of our research is Enron's management of
intellectual capital as a critical strategic resource.  We'd like to
understand how Enron attracts, recruits, motivates and develops top talent
and how it creates the behavioral context that ensures that individual
entrepreneurial initiative is incorporated into organizational bloodstream.

Prof. Bartlett has already met with Jeff Skilling and Greg Whalley.  Jeff
suggested Prof. Bartlett meet Ken Lay, Gene Humphrey, Mark Frevert, Andrew
Fastow and Cindy Olsen.

I've met Mark Palmer and Steve Kean as well as Louise Kitchen
(EnronOnline), Ken Rice, David Cox, Kevin Hannon, and Richard diMichele
(Broadband Business).  We are planning to take Enron's culture for a test
drive in a separate case study on Louise Kitchen and EnronOnline launch.

Here are the dates that will work for us:
October 10  13
October 18  20
October 26-27
November 20-21

Thank you for your help, and please let me know if you need any additional
information.

Best regards,
Meg

I

Stelzer@aol.com,Advisory group,"Fri, 6 Oct 2000 04:33:00 -0700 (PDT)","I believe that you agreed at our last meeting that it might be well for you
and me -- and Ken if available -- to discuss plans for this group in 2001. My
feeling is that we should review its composition after the election -- we may
lose Larry or want to add a Democrat (Laura Tyson?); we can take a hard look
at who is contributing and who isn't etc.
My agenda would be:
1. What can be done to increase the value to Enron? As I see it we have two
purposes: to create fans of and spokepersons for the company in important
fora, and to enrich management's understanding of the outside world (what it
is like, and how it views some of the problems that Enron faces).
2. What are the likely topics that it would be valuable for Enron to discuss
in 2001, as best we can judge things at this early point in time?
3. What should the composition of the group consist of in 2001, given
whatever we decide in #1 and #2 above.
4. How can we maximize the chance of achieving Ken's objective of attracting
outside guest speakers? Advance scheduling? Fees? And what sorts would we
like to attract?
I am sure there are many other items; these are designed merely to start you
thinking.
Let me start the bidding by suggesting November 29 or December 4, inn
Washington if you happen to be in town, in Houston if that is more 
convenient.","[('What', 3), ('Enron', 3), ('I', 3)]"

"""Frederic Sicre"" <usameeting@weforum.org>","World Economic Forum - USA Meeting 2001, Washington DC, 4-5 April","Fri, 6 Oct 2000 10:58:00 -0700 (PDT)","To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
ENRON CORPORATION

Dear Dr Lay,

While it appears that the US economy is moving towards the much-talked
about 'soft-landing', there are nevertheless imbalances - particularly the
severe shortage of labor and surging trade deficit - which have given
global business leaders reason to be wary. Add to this scenario the new
political landscape, and the recent hike in oil prices, and there is every
reason to pay close attention to the USA in early 2001.

Taking place within the first 100 days of the new Administration, the USA
Meeting 2001 will bring together key members of the cabinet and
congressional leadership, several hundred chief executives from over forty
countries, as well as renowned experts and media leaders. In our usual
Davos-style interactive discussions, we will analyse the current state of
the world's largest market against the backdrop of the global economy.

Held in collaboration with the National Chamber Foundation, the USA Meeting
takes place at the headquarters of the US Chamber of Commerce, across from
the White House. The Meeting is widely recognised as the premier Washington
event for business leaders from the United States and around the world.

A full brochure will be sent to you after the election but wanted to take
the opportunity to inform you at this early stage so you can already block
April 4-5, 2001 on your agenda. I hope that I will have the pleasure of
welcoming you in Washington, DC next April, and look forward to hearing
from you soon.

For further information, please do not hesitate to contact Chantal
Humbert-Droz at (41 22) 869 1442 or e-mail: usameeting@weforum.org. You may
also consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/usa, where information will

"""Watch Watch"" <Watch@CSIS.ORG>","CSIS Watch October 6, 2000 Number 235","Fri, 6 Oct 2000 09:12:00 -0700 (PDT)","This message contains the latest issue of the CSIS Watch, focusing on Energy 
Trends and Geopolitics.

For further information, contact the CSIS Director of Studies Office at

*********************************************

Energy Trends and Geopolitics.

The OPEC heads-of-state summit should be appraised on three different levels, 
according to Luis Giusti, CSIS senior adviser. Despite speculation that 
decisions about the market would be forthcoming, nothing was bound to happen 
because the operational agenda will be dealt with in the organization's 
meeting in November. At the institutional level, the summit was undoubtedly a 
success for OPEC, as it clearly reinforced the spirit of the organization by 
strengthening the union among member countries. Additionally, at the 
political level the meeting provided a platform for Venezuelan president Hugo 
Chavez to deliver what has become his ""north-south"" position and message. It 
is important to keep in mind, though, that Saudi Arabia's dominance and 
leadership will continue, by virtue of its high production capacity, and we 
can expect continuity in its pragmatic approach toward the market and the 
price of oil. As a result, Chavez's speeches should be viewed in perspective 
and not overplayed.

As for the United States' release of 30 million barrels of oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), Giusti says that the move has clearly 
provoked an immediate reaction in the desired direction, with oil prices 
falling some $5 per barrel. In tapping the SPR at this moment, the U.S. 
action denotes a mode of cooperation and not confrontation. OPEC countries 
have already increased production significantly, and they have repeatedly 
sent the message that they have done their part and somebody else has to do 
something to bring down prices. The move comes too late, however, to bring 
any relief to the winter's tight oil heating situation: aside from the fact 
that the U.S. refining network is operating at practically full capacity, the 
oil released will not be refined before December, and, as a result, the 
refined products will not start reaching the market before January. But the 
move does have an effect on the price of oil, which is the root of the 
problem. As for the Heating Oil Strategic Reserve currently being accrued, 
its small size (2 million barrels) can have only a modest impact on prices. 
Moreover, its triggering mechanism is not yet clear.

Robert Ebel, director of the CSIS Energy Program, thinks the United States 
should not touch the reserve. Domestic oil producers are finally turning a 
profit and will be unhappy as crude oil prices fall. Moreover, just-in-time 
philosophies of operation keep stocks low, meaning the inventories simply 
will not be there if demand rises sharply this winter despite the release of 
reserves. Ebel suggests that New England take steps to diversify the kinds of 
fuel consumed during the winter.

According to Ebel, the reserve withdraw is playing to the psychological part 
of the market more than anything else. After the announcement of the reserve 
withdraw, prices began to drop without a single new drop of oil entering the 
marketplace. What will happen next August when it is time to replenish the 
reserve, wonders Ebel.

Moreover, U.S. refineries are already operating at 95%-96% capacity daily. To 
make room in the refineries for the reserve oil, the United States will have 
to give up some of the oil it imports. This crowding out of imports will 
bring down prices elsewhere, notes Ebel. The United States is therefore 
subsidizing foreign consumers. Ebel says the United States should have 
coordinated the reserve withdraw with other countries if it truly wanted to 
have a global impact on prices.

Turning to Iraq, the high price of oil contributes to the erosion of the 
sanctions in place. Iraqi oil now plays a key role in global supplies and 
prices. This gives the Iraqi regime increased leverage, says Charles Duelfer, 
a visiting fellow in the CSIS Middle East Program.

While Iraq is unlikely to actually halt its oil exports, the potential to do 
so provides Iraq with a ""deterrent force"" of some significance. Iraq made 
modest reductions in output earlier this year when the UN sanctions committee 
delayed approval of funding for oil infrastructure repairs. The Iraqi regime 
has a great appreciation of power-whether through weapons of mass destruction 
or through oil. Iraq can be expected to take every opportunity to increase 
its production capacity as circumstances permit, perhaps with an ultimate 
goal of displacing Saudi Arabia as OPEC's dominant player.

Subject:? Governors Conference 



Dear Ken, 

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you. 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of 
Ohio, has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring 
on natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off 
(in contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the 
current chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be 
under the auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and 
a lot of other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very 
timely event. 

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be 
kicking off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high 
visibility platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and 
honored -- to have you in that featured role in it works for your schedule. 

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms 
very large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill 
you in further on what they would like to accomplish. 

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best, 

Dan

THE HILL REPORT
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of September 30 - October 6, 2000


This Week in Washington, the United States House of Representatives
continued its work on the appropriations process for funding of the
fiscal year of 2001.  The House passed the conference reports on
the energy, interior and transportation appropriations bills.   We
also passed a continuing resolution agreement that will keep the
government running until all 13 appropriations bills are passed and
signed into law by the president.

On Monday of this week, as Chairman of the Congressional Results
Caucus and a member of the Congressional Cyber Security Caucus, I
toured the high-tech corridor of Boston, Massachusetts today to learn
about high-tech issues such as information security, e-signature
legislation and Internet taxation.

I organized the trip to draw attention to the need for more implementation
of information technology security not only among federal and other
governmental agencies but in the private sector as well.  The Congressional
Cyber Security Caucus exists in part to educate other members of
Congress and government agencies of the vital need for secure information
technology systems.

The trip came on the heels of a recent General Accounting Office
(GAO) report to Congress that clearly stated that too many government
operations and assets remain at risk of cyber attack.  The GAO discovered
serious security flaws at major federal agencies such as the Treasury
Department and the Department of Defense - situations clearly indicating
large potential threats to citizen privacy and national security.

Some of the computer systems that run our national defense and military
operations are literally an open target to hostile nations or terrorists
who have cyber terrorism technology.  Both accidental and intentional
attacks on these very systems have been detected and we must take
steps to stop them.

I was joined by Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier (R-CA), Congressman
Tom Davis (R-VA), Congressman Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), Congresswoman
Nancy Johnson (R-CT), Congressman John Sununu (R-NH), Congressman
Jack Quinn (R-NY), Congressman John Sweeney (R-NY), and other prominent
business, community and financial leaders.

We attended a meeting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
with area CEOs and high-tech leaders, representing the financial,
communications and technology community.  The discussion was hosted
by TechNet Massachusetts to discuss creating digital opportunities,
H-1B visas, protection of online privacy, and taxation of Internet
transactions.

I believe that any government agency using information systems and
is linked to the outside world MUST have an efficient and secure
information security system.  The potential privacy and security
threat is not something we should take lightly and unfortunately
too many high-level government officials are doing just that!

Any major business, industry or government organization must consider
the threat of cyber attack and how it could be a devastating situation
to customers and citizens.  I can't imagine any of my constituents
being interested in having their private banking information being
made public to anyone on the Internet.  Security and privacy must
be a priority and the businesses and organizations that possess this
sensitive information can not afford the risk of intrusion.

Members also met with high-tech officials, Governor Paul Cellucci
(R-MA), and Lt. Governor Jane Swift (R-MA) to discuss the future
of the information technology industry as well as pending legislation
in Congress designed to address the pressing needs of New Economy
companies.

Earlier this year, I digitally signed the ""The e-Contract 2000"" with
high-tech America to renew his commitment to promoting the New Economy
in the 21st century.

I pledge to continue my legislative and oversight efforts to remove
the barriers to future innovation, competition, and growth.  Freedom
is the answer, not government intervention.
The New Economy has created limitless opportunities in America today
for consumers, companies and workers alike.

The e-Contract 2000 outlines a number of policies the Republican-controlled
Congress has designed to promote continued growth in the New Economy,
such as ""Reducing Taxation, Regulation, and Litigation"" and ""Promoting
Free Trade and E-Commerce.""

Also this year I voted for continued growth in the new economy by
supporting the ""Internet Non-Discrimination Act"" (H.R. 3709), to
extend the current Internet tax moratorium for an additional 5 years,
through 2006.  The bill passed in the U.S. House of Representatives
by a vote of 352-75.

The tremendous growth of e-commerce has created thousands of high-wage
jobs in this country and has led to countless new choices for Texas
consumers.  The group with me today believes the New Economy should
remain unfettered by burdensome taxes and regulation, to ensure continued
growth and innovation into the 21st century.

Around Texas...

Last Friday, I spoke to the advanced placement Government and Economics
classes at Palestine High School.  I pointed out to them that our
Constitutional form of government is really just an on-going experiment,
and that the continued success of our country depends on the participation
of all of our citizens.  I told them that I am confident that we
can solve every problem in America.  I always enjoy speaking with
enthusiastic young people, and I want to give every student an opportunity
to experience and understand our government.

On Saturday I went to the St. Thomas - Aquinas children's carnival,
and that evening I attended a fundraising event to benefit ""For the
Love of the Lake.""  This is one of my favorite community projects.
 I have adopted part of the shoreline of White Rock Lake, and would
encourage all of you to come help out at our ""Second Saturday Clean-up.""
 See my web site for more information.

Tomorrow I will see my friends in Anderson County at the Anderson
County Cattle Baron's Ball.  And in two weeks, I will be in Bryan
for a Town Hall Meeting.  See the notice at the end of this e-mail.

Next week Congress is hoping to finish its work on the budget for
fiscal year 2001.

Have a great weekend! - Pete

candidates we support. We will continue to keep you updated
on these events and hope you will come out to show your support
for these pro-business candidates when he is in your area.

However, we need to make sure the U.S. Chamber PAC is able to

for pro-business candidates who have been there for us when it
has counted most and who will be there for us in the future.
The guidelines above are merely suggestions and you may give
more or less, or not at all without concern of favor,
disadvantage, or reprisal.

Thank you and I hope the U.S. Chamber PAC can count on your
support today!

As reported Carlos Chacho Alvarez resigned his position Friday as Vice=20

The main reason of this resignation was a political disagreement with Cabin=

and to move beyond the Senate scandal.

The main changes in the cabinet, announced on Thursday 5th, are the followi=

Chistian Colombo (economist, in good relationship with Machinea) will repla=

Machinea (Minister of Economy) will also be responsible of the Ministry of=

Jorge De la R?a (former General Secretary of the President and President's=

brother) will be Minister of Justice.=20
Patricia Bullrich (peronist) will be Minister of Labor.=20

As a consequence of Alvarez' resignation, Flamarique resigned to his positi=

of General Secretary of the President.

Regarding the preliminary impact of the political changes to the economic=

Before Alvarez resignation, the cabinet changes were considered positive=20

Although Alvarez (the leader of the Frepaso party) said he will be still pa=

philip.rhind@za.hsbcib.com,Your AIPN presentation,"Mon, 9 Oct 2000 08:51:00 -0700 (PDT)","Dear Sir,

I  had  the  misfortune  recently  of listening to your presentation at the 
AIPN
conference in Cape Town, South Africa. I had to leave immediately following 
your
talk , otherwise I would have challenged you about the contents of you talk. 
You
used  this  opportunity  to  criticise  bankers  (lenders)  as  you  called 
them
referring  to  them  as  quote ""concrete shoes"" and also criticised 
para-statals
commenting that ""they never offer to buy you lunch."" Such idiotic references 
are
not  what  I would expect from an officer of Enron Corporation. Although your 
cv
indicates  that infact you are part of Merrill International. It is not clear 
if
you are also an officer of Enron.

I  as  a  Director of HSBC Investment Bank , plus my UK and RSA based 
colleagues
have over recent years spent a considerable amount of time and money  
performing
various  studies  for  Enron  iro  the proposed MISP and gas export project 
plus
Project ""Sunshine"" etc.  HSBC have not billed Enron for any of this work.

I  had the pleasure of meeting  Dr Ken Lay at CERA in February and amongst 
other
things  he  referred  to  the  various  problems  Enron had experienced wrt 
this
project  and  stated  that quote  ""Enron do not build steel plants.""  This 
clear
and  honest  comment  from  your  boss  is  welcome  and  this is indeed 
Enron's
prerogative.  What  I  object  to  frankly  is a presentation that maintains 
the
pretence  of a project and seeks to blame third parties such as lenders and 
para
statal organisations for difficulties you may have experienced.

I suggest that it is in everyone's interest to speak openely and 
constructively.
I  for one have no problem at all Enron saying that their future is in 
broadband
and not in steel plants in Mozambique.

If  anyone  is  interested in my own views as to how things could have been 
done
differently out here I would be delighted to let you  or Dr Lay know.

Yours sincerely,

Philip Rhind

Subject: Forum Topic - HALFTIME & BEYOND



Just a few notes to give some thought to before attending our meeting this 
evening.






HALFTIME - an interval in a person's life where he or she explores ways to 
transform their success into significance.



What is it that you have always wanted to do?  And why haven't you done it 
yet?






HALFTIME DRILL:

 Answer the following questions to help you take stock of your first half as 
you prepare for a better second half.  Be honest, and write down your answers.

1) What do I want to be remembered for? Write a description of how your life 
would look if it turned out just the way you wished.

2) What about money?
How much is enough?
If I have more than enough, what purpose do I serve with the excess?
If I have less than enough, what am I willing to do to correct that?

3) How am I feeling about my career now?
Is this what I want to be doing with my life ten years from now?

4) Am I living a balanced life?
What are the important elements in my life that deserve more time?

5) What is the primary loyalty in my life?

6) Where do I look for inspiration, mentors and working models for my second 
half?

7) Peter Drucker says that two important needs are self-realization and 
community.  On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest), how am I doing in 
these areas?

8) Draw a line that describes the ups and downs of your life.  Or draw three 
lines, one for personal life, one for family life, and one for work life.  
Where do they intersect?  Where do they diverge?

9) Which of the following transition options seems to fit my temperament and 
gifts best?
(Evaluate each option on a sale of 1-10)
a. Keep on doing what I already do well, but change the environment.
b. Change the work, but stay in the same environment.
c. Turn an avocation into a new career.
d. Double-track (or even triple-track) in parallel careers (not hobbies).
e. Keep on doing what I'm doing, even past retirement age.

10) What do I want for my children?

Coleman at some time, but it may neet to wait until

Friday).
I hope you guys had a good time in Palm Beach. Houston

Nina Garcia,SALE OF FALCON 900B (#N5733),"Mon, 9 Oct 2000 07:30:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken,

Earlier this year when the decision was made to purchase our new GV aircraft, 
we agreed to move forward with plans to sell one of our Falcon 900B's by 
year-end.

This allows for Aviation to maintain a six aircraft domestic fleet, once the 
GV is delivered and operational at the beginning of the 2nd quarter of next 
year.  Our '01 budget forecast is based on this assumption.

A year-end sale avoids ad valorem tax issues.  It reduces our fleet to five 
during the 1st quarter, which is also the limit that we can operate aircraft, 
i.e., several pilots unavailable (at GV flight training during this period).

Gary Fitch advises that Jeff and Joe do not have a preference on which 
aircraft to sell.  Gary prefers selling the Falcon 900B (#N5733), since it 
has only one lavatory.  The aircraft is 12 years old, in excellent condition, 
and has a market value of $20-22 million (lease buy-out of $19 million).

With your concurrence, we will contract with an aircraft broker and place the 
Falcon on the market.

Bill","[('aircraft', 6), ('Falcon', 3), ('GV', 3)]"

"""Tom Glassanos"" <tom.glassanos@xign.com>",Enron Experience,"Mon, 9 Oct 2000 13:53:00 -0700 (PDT)","Hi Ken,

I read with interest today about Enron on your corporate web site and your
recognition as one of the top U.S. CEOs. Such success usually results from a
history of strong business and customer relationships. With this in mind, I
felt compelled to bring my one and only experience with Enron to your
attention.

I am President, CEO of Xign Corporation located in Pleasanton, CA.  Our
company is developing software for electronic payments.  Our board of
directors includes Charles Schwab and Bob Kimmitt (former U.S. Ambassador to
Germany and President of Commerce One).

Our company signed an intent last June with Enron to sublease an office
building.  My team worked in good faith with Enron people for 5 months
waiting for a draft lease.  During this period we were delayed time and
again by ""lack of legal resources"" to complete the contract.  Last month we
were told that Enron still wanted to lease the space, but the vacancy would
be delayed one month (from the original October 15th date).  Two weeks ago
we were told that a November date was at risk and the lease could not be
signed.

This week the Enron representative told us (1) there is no occupancy date
that can be established and (2) Enron is not willing or interested in
telling us when we they can set a date.  End of conversation.

Our company has pursued this matter for six months with assurances by Enron
of their intention to move forward in good faith.  My company is now down to
100 days in our current lease in a market with very little available space.
This will materially effect our operation and our shareholders.  Enron did
not legally commit to the lease. But continued reassurances of the intent to
sign the lease, misled us.  We won't make a similar mistake in the future.

We all operate as members of a business community.  I'm sure my experience
with Enron is not reflective of your organization as a whole. I would
certainly appreciate if you could have someone look into this matter and
let us know if there might be a solution to this situation that works well
for all parties.

Thank you very much,


Tom Glassanos

CRENSHAW_NEWTON_F@LILLY.COM,Visit to Enron,"Thu, 24 Aug 2000 04:19:00 -0700 (PDT)","Greg and Louise,

Thanks for taking time out of  your schedule to spend some time with Alph
Bingham and me this week.  You and your team are breaking new ground in
your business with impressive speed.  We hope to match that type of
performance within e.Lilly.

I had several key takeaways that were notewothy:

1. Build your e.commerce strategy from the customer's perspective.  Louise,
you demonstrated this by the intense focus on the traders' requirements for
EnronOnline.
2. As Peter Drucker points out in his 1994 article on the ""Theory of
Business"", you must have clear assumptions about your environment, mission
and core competencies.  The establishment of Enron Networks seems to be
built upon your strong ability to assess a potential market for
commoditization and then leverage your strong trading capabilities and
control processes in order to create or redefine the market(eg. pulp/paper,
steel,bandwidth).
3. You provide people a chance to understand the business and be
accountable early in their career.  The example of one of your top traders
illustrated the performance-based culture that you are developing while
other examples showed the business breadth that is provided to key talent.
4. In the new economy (probably in the old one, too), there is no defense,
only offense.  Again, that mantra seems to grow out of a strong bias for
action within Enron Networks as you recognize that you must re-create
yourself (Online gas market) and move aggressively into new ones.
5. Louise, your EnronOnline initiative epitomized the phrase:  ""Ask for
forgiveness, not for permission.""  In other words, get it done; get it done
right, and the little things - like the budget - will take care of
themselves.

Let me know if we can ever return the favor.  Greg, we may want to discuss
a few risk management questions with you sometime in the future as we are
building some innovative discovery research ventures that would benefit
from your insight in this area.

Thanks again for your time.  Please thank Liz Taylor for us as well.  She
was very helpful.

Mr. Lay,

I hope you don't mind the unsolicited email. I am interested in founding an=

will be used to select America's Most Admired Companies, as well as the Most

It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of
Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite
you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September
16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to  know more about the
University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush
volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person
in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing,
boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN
UNIVERSITY.

The tentative schedule of events is as follows:
Saturday September 16 - Fun activities (sailing, boating, golf, etc.)
Sunday September 17 ---- Reception and dinner at the home of President and
Mrs. Bush
Monday Morning ------------ ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TSU
Monday afternoon ---------- Return to Houston

I know TSU is your favorite topic and we look forward to you joining us.  An
invitation is in the mail.  I will call you when you return.

Chris Davis has sent me a formal letter  of resignation from the Compaq

I will be sending Chris a note from the  board, but it might also be a good

know, since accepting my current position at ONI  Systems, the company's 
requirements on my time have made it difficult for me to  be as proactively

involved with Compaq as I feel a board member should  be. 

??????? Therefore,  I believe it is in our mutual best interest that I submit 
my resignation from  the Board effective September 25,  2000.???????? I 
certainly enjoyed  

my involvement with the Board and I appreciate the  Board's understanding of

I wanted to advise you that, as you and Gene Lockhart have discussed, we made 
a change in our executive team today.  Jim Badum has moved out of the Chief 
Marketing Officer role to assume the new position of Managing Director, 
Strategic Development.  Concurrently, Nick Utton has joined NewPower as 
Managing Director, Chief Marketing Officer.

A copy of our internal organization is attached, and the transition has gone 
very smoothly.  I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have, and can 
be reached at 203-531-0400, ext. 623.

Society banquet program this Friday night.  At the end of this e-mail is
your portion of the ""script"" for this event.  The entire script will be in a
notebook at the podium.

Besides introductions (primarily some of our students who will be there),
the program will include remarks from the chancellor, the induction of new
members of the Society, announcements of other large new gifts, and some
musical entertainment.  Jack and Mary Bush of Dallas, Texas are co-chairs of
the Davenport Society this year.  Both are MU alums.  Jack retired several
years ago as president of Michaels Store, the large arts-and-crafts
retailer; he's now involved in retail and e-commerce consulting.

We will have at least 225 alumni, business people from the area, university
leaders, faculty, staff, and students in attendance.  A couple reminders:
It is black tie.  And the event is being held at the Reynolds Alumni Center
on campus, with reception at 6 and dinner at 7.  We intend/hope to end by
9:30.

You will be introduced by Jack Bush.  As you can see below, we have allotted
about 10 minutes for the keynote talk.  The starting time for your talk is
approximate, but we strive to stay on schedule.  Last Friday, I responded to
an e-mail from Rob Bradley regarding your keynote talk.  He indicated that
he would be preparing the talk.  (Rob, would you confirm that you received
my e-mail of last Friday.  Thanks.)

Then we will have another 10 minutes or so devoted to the announcement of
the Pinkney Walker Professorship.  As you can see, I'll introduce this part
after thanking you for your keynote remarks.  The professorship plaque that
will hang in the foyer of Middlebush Hall (and, soon, Cornell Hall) has
arrived so we will be able to show it to the audience and to Pinkney.  We'll
have it on stage and I'll hold it while you read the wording (see below).

If you desire, you can add personal comments about Pinkney after reading the
inscription on the plaque.  If you want them placed in the podium script,
just have them sent to me via e-mail; likewise, with any changes or
corrections to the portion below.  Of course, you can speak extemporaneously
about Pinkney or bring prepared remarks about him with you.  Then we'll
allow Pinkney to say a few words.  It should be splendid.

By the way, during the dinner, you will be seated with Pinkney and his wife
Sheila, Dulari Mehta (a College of Business student from the Dallas area who
is hosting the Walkers, who are new Davenport Society members), Richard
Schwartz (dean of A&S), and Michael Kateman and Lindsay Lopez (both from the
A&S development office)

Of course, if you, Rob, or Rosalee have questions, you can call either my
assistant Carol Ritter or me at 573/882-6688.  See you Friday evening.
Thanks again.

[Bruce Walker joins Lay at podium.]


8:31 - 8:36  ANNOUNCEMENT OF P. WALKER PROFESSORSHIP

Bruce Walker: Thank you very much, Ken.

We are truly honored and grateful that you have returned to Mizzou this
evening.

At this banquet two years ago, Ken announced the start of a campaign to
establish an endowment in the College of Business in honor of Pinkney C.
Walker.

Ken, along with Harold Hook and Bob Pugh, agreed to lead the effort to raise
funds for this endowment.

Pinkney, would you please come up and join Ken and me.

Many of you are familiar with Pinkney.

Those of you who don't know Pinkney probably have 2 questions in mind.

Are these two Walker guys related?

And the answer is no.

Why does Pinkney Walker deserve such as honor?

Well, let me tell you a little bit about him.

A native of Graham, Texas, Pinkney's academic degrees include a bachelor's
from the University of Texas and an MBA and a doctorate from the Wharton
School at the University of Pennsylvania.

Pinkney's association with MU dates back to 1940.

Eventually, he became a professor of economics, who -- according to one
estimate -- taught as many as 40,000 students at Mizzou.

Pinkney also served as the college's dean from 1964 to 1971.

He left the university to become a member of the Federal Power Commission.

Now, he is enjoying the good life of a professor emeritus, residing in Fort
Myers, Florida, with his wife Sheila.

We knew the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment would be dedicated to building
excellence in the college.

But we didn't know if the endowment eventually would fund a scholarship or
two, faculty research, or a faculty position.

That would depend on how much money was raised.

Well, tonight, as Paul Harvey would say, Ken is back with the rest of the
story.

Ken. . .


Ken Lay: It is with great pride and pleasure that I can tell you
tonight that the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment has received gifts totaling
$550,000, which means it will fund a distinguished professorship in the
college.

Here is the plaque that will hang in Middlebush Hall and eventually will be
moved to Cornell Hall.

It reads:

Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship
College of Business

Established in recognition of Dr. Walker's teaching excellence
and his significant contributions as dean, public servant, and friend.

Endowed in 2000 by alumni and friends of the University of Missouri.

Pinkney, please accept our congratulations.

Would you like to say a few words.

EFFICIENCY NEWS

New Proposed Air Conditioner, Heat Pump Standards Fall Short

The new air conditioner energy efficiency standards proposed by the U.S.
Department of Energy fall short of what's justified and what's needed to
lighten the load on electricity demand, says the Alliance to Save Energy. In
a humorous ad campaign developed by the Appliance Standards Awareness
project and featuring Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in digitally-inserted
sunglasses, energy efficiency advocates, urge strong air conditioner
standards. Air conditioners are the largest single contributors to peak
electricity demand - an issue the past two summers as peak demands created
and threatened blackouts and brownouts in various locations. This proposed
legislation is currently in a 60-day public comment period, allowing for
input from interested parties, after which the DOE will issue the final
rule.

Winter Fuel Outlook Bleak, EIA Reveals in New Report

The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that natural gas prices
will increase by as much as 40 to 50 percent for consumers this winter over
last winter, or an average of $240 per consumer home, in its Winter Fuels
Outlook, released on October 6. Home heating oil prices are expected to rise
by $190 per home from last year's already high prices in the Northeast,
while electricity prices could increase by as much as 12 percent.
Predictions are based on normal winter weather, and prices could escalate
even further should the weather prove to be colder than normal.

--------------------------------

Gains Expected in Federal Budget for Energy Efficiency Programs

Holding a strong hand due to concerns over sharply rising energy prices and
low winter natural gas and heating oil inventories, and backed by a strong
lobbying effort from the Alliance to Save Energy  and others, the Clinton
administration is expected to win substantial gains for energy efficiency
programs in recently concluded negotiations with Congressional appropriators
over the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection
Agency budget. A total of $814 million is being appropriated for energy
efficiency research, development and deployment programs, run by the DOE's
Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, in increase of $94
million, or 13 percent over the previous budget.

Avoid Home Energy $ticker $hock

If you thought it was expensive to pay up to $2 a gallon for gas this
summer, you'll have continued ""$ticker $hock"" when your home energy bills
arrive this winter with predicted increases. How to avoid it -- check out

Energy Heats Up Election

Each presidential candidate stated his energy policy in the first
presidential debate in Boston, MA, on October 3. Vice President Al Gore's
plan focuses on increasing supply and decreasing demand, while Texas
Governor George W. Bush's plan emphasizes developing domestic energy
supplies. The vice presidential candidates faced off in Danville, KY on
October 5, both echoing the positions of their presidential running mates.

California, New York Make Dramatic Boosts for Energy-Efficiency Funding

In California, bills signed by Governor Gray Davis last week re-assert
California's leadership status on support for energy efficiency and other
clean energy sources. Two bills extend California's system benefits charge
through 2012, while adding an inflation adjustment, creating more than $5
billion of investment in clean energy from 2002-2012. This may be the
largest clean energy fund ever created. A third major bill will speed the
adoption of cost-effective buildings and appliance standards. These measures
are expected to maximize peak energy savings for the summer of 2001, and to
lessen future energy reliability problems.

ed.html

And in Los Angeles, the City Council approved a 10-year power plan that will
meet roughly half of the 1000 megawatts of new power capacity with renewable
energy sources, distributed generation, and demand side management.

http://www.ase.org/e-FFICIENCY/losangeles.htm

The New York State Public Service Commission has proposed increasing the
state's System Benefits Charge from its current $78 million to $139 million
per year, and extending it for five years. About 70 percent of the current
$78 million is used for energy efficiency programs. If this formula holds,
efficiency funding would increase to about $97 million - an 80 percent
increase from current levels. Energy advocates are seeking SBC funding
closer to the $200 million level.

EPA, DOE Release Fuel Economy Guide for Energy Awareness Month

Kicking off Energy Awareness Month in October, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy issued the latest
version of the Fuel Economy Guide. Including the 2001 model year, this guide
ranks the fuel efficiency of vehicles in various class sizes. The Toyota
Prius and Honda Insight currently top the list for fuel efficiency.

Light Up Your Life with ENERGY STAR

ENERGY STAR's Lighting Change Out program takes place this week. A
first-time event involving utilities and retailers across the U.S., the
program encourages consumers to trade in halogen lamps for cooler, ENERGY
STAR labeled, efficient models. Each halogen torchiere that is replaced by
an ENERGY STAR torchiere can save $25-$50 per year in energy costs.

Living Efficiently and Affordably

The U.S. Department of Energy has partnered with the housing industry
through the Building American Program to build affordable, highly
energy-efficient homes throughout the U.S. The Fairburn Commons complex in
an Atlanta suburb opened with 33 units, each of which will cost less than
$1/day to heat and cool.

http://www.doe.gov/news/releases00/seppr/pr00240.htm


Meanwhile, the National Affordable Housing Network released a report on new
energy-efficient, affordable homes built in Texas. Built in partnership with
Habitat for Humanity International, these 40 homes use up to 42 percent less
energy than an average new home. Reduced monthly energy bills are
particularly critical for low-income residents.

IN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE:
1. Holding Bureaucrats Personally Accountable: A 1st Amendment Victory
2. The Independent Review: Fall Issue Now Available
3. Public Health vs. The Nanny State? -- Next Independent Policy
Forum (10/26/00)

-------------------------------------------------------------

HOLDING BUREAUCRATS PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE: A 1st Amendment Victory

The legal doctrine of ""sovereign immunity"" -- and its modern cousin,
""qualified immunity"" -- has historically allowed government
bureaucrats to escape full accountability for misdeeds they have
perpetrated under the guise of government ""policy."" Thus, a recent
decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals -- ruling that a group
of government bureaucrats may be held personally liable for
outrageous constitutional violations -- is news worthy of celebration.

The facts of the case attest to the need for strong checks on
government power. Three Berkeley, Calif., residents had campaigned
against a proposed homeless shelter in their neighborhood. At the
behest of local ""housing rights"" activists, who said the anti-shelter
campaign was discriminatory and violated the Fair Housing Act, the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) got into the
act. HUD officials demanded interviews with the three anti-shelter
neighbors, told their neighbors they had violated the law, and
ordered them to give HUD all materials -- including the names,
addresses and phone numbers of other opponents of the shelter -- that
they had collected for their campaign. To the ""Berkeley Three,"" HUD's
harassment violated their freedom of speech. To the appeals court,
""qualified immunity"" of government bureaucrats did not apply here;
the Berkeley Three may proceed with their First Amendment lawsuit
against the HUD officials and seek monetary damages.

This ruling, although unusual by today's standards, harks back to
another early legal tradition: the idea that citizens can hold
government officials personally liable for improper conduct. In 1763,
John Wilkes, a member of Britain's parliament, was the subject of an
outrageous search and seizure warrant issued by Secretary of State
Lord Halifax, after Wilkes published an anonymous attack on the
government. Wilkes then sued Halifax and other officials and was
awarded a sum comparable to $20 million today. Americans were so
enraptured with this refutation of unrestrained government power that
they made Wilkes a hero and followed in his footsteps, suing
government officials for unreasonable search and seizures.

Since the 19th century, however, this common-law tradition has nearly
withered away. The creation of the exclusionary rule has replaced
Wilkes's remedy with an inferior one. While the exclusionary rule
brings some satisfaction to criminals who are the subject of
unreasonable searches and seizures, it does nothing for the innocent.
Furthermore, the 20th century has seen the rise of the doctrine of
""qualified immunity,"" which the U.S. Supreme Court explains ""seeks to
ensure that [government] defendants 'reasonably can anticipate when
their conduct may give rise to liability,' by attaching liability
only if '[t]he contours of the right [violated are] sufficiently
clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is
doing violates that right.'""

The Ninth Circuit's recent ruling that HUD officials were not acting
reasonably when they violated the First Amendment rights of the
Berkeley Three is refreshing because it rekindles the idea that civil
liability can be a restraint on government power. In an era when
bureaucratic violations of the rule of law have become routine, it is
an idea long overdue.

THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW: Fall Issue Now Available

* Why did urban rioters of the 1960s target small businesses -- and
why have so many commentators rationalized the mob violence?
* Are some school-choice proposals more promising than others?
* Have economists been too quiet on Medicare reform?
* Is taxation morally defensible?
* How did racism affect employment on the early railroads?
* Why do government bureaucracies in general, and public education in
particular, produce such deplorable outcomes?
* Why did Reaganomics turn out as it did?

These topics and more are discussed in the Fall 2000 issue of THE
INDEPENDENT REVIEW: A Journal of Political Economy, the Independent
Institute's 160-page quarterly. Contributors to the fall issue

PUBLIC HEALTH vs. THE NANNY STATE? -- Next Independent Policy Forum (10/26/00)

Barely a day goes by without some news of the latest public health
""threat."" Serious health hazards, we are told, lurk around every
corner -- in water supplies, air, soil, beverages, fast food,
second-hand smoke, cellular phones, and food irradiation, just to
name a handful. And yet, Americans today live longer than ever! Are
markets and private decision-making providing the answers? Or are
these dangers real, immediate, and a legitimate mandate for
government control? Can we reduce or eliminate health risks without
government dictates? How does politics distort perceptions about
public health? Will Americans succumb to or rebel against the growing
Nanny State's neo-Puritanism and attack on individual choice and
responsibility? JACOB SULLUM and THOMAS DiLORENZO will discuss these
timely and important issues.

SPEAKERS:

      - Jacob Sullum (Senior Editor, Reason magazine; Author, FOR YOUR
OWN GOOD: The Anti-Smoking Crusade and the Tyranny of Public Health)

      - Thomas DiLorenzo (Professor of Economics, Loyola College of
Maryland; Co-author, FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS: Public Health in
America)

       Reception and book signing: 6:30 p.m.
       Program: 7:00 - 8:30 p.m.

About FOR YOUR OWN GOOD: The Anti-Smoking Crusade and the Tyranny of
Public Health:

""Sullum is meticulously logical, and his conclusions are implicit in
everything he argues. FOR YOUR OWN GOOD has made us think about
totalitarianism in this most unlikely context.""
      - NEW YORK TIMES

""Intriguing and worthwhile, this book marshals an impressive array of
facts and arguments. Thoughtful and articulate.""
      - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE

About FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS: Public Health in America:

""FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS argues that public health has become a
bureaucracy that feels the need to perpetuate itself by expanding
into new areas that are more often than not, just plain 'politically
correct.'""
      - WALL STREET JOURNAL

I was very disappointed to learn today that the Enron Body Shop will be
raising its rates to $25 per month.  While this may be in line with some
benchmarking study, one would hope that Enron would seek to outperform its
peers, given its goal to be rated #1 as best place to work.  Our cross-town
competitor Williams, where I worked for almost 12 years, has a facility that
is at least as good as Enron's, and there is no charge whatsoever.  Why
charge for the use of a facility that promotes Wellness?

I hope you reconsider this increase, but at a minimum provide a lower rate
for the occasional user such as myself.  Given my busy schedule I am lucky
to get there a few times per month, and would happily pay the greater of $5
per visit or the $25/month fee.  A $25/month fee will simply discourage
occasional users.

Please terminate my membership, effective September 1.   I hope that I am
not alone in voicing my unhappiness with this increase.

Sincerely,

Michael Mann,UTC Sales Call,"Wed, 11 Oct 2000 05:07:00 -0700 (PDT)","At UTC's request, yesterday Mike Jackson and I met with Kent Brittan, VP, 
Global Sourcing, and members of his sourcing group.  As you remember, we 
first met Kent when Tom White, Dan Leff, Harold Buchanan and I called on him 
two years ago.  At the time, we presented an early version of a fully bundled 
energy outsource in partnership with Fluor Daniel and a local real estate 
management firm.

Over the last two years, UTC attempted various energy procurement strategies, 
failing to execute any.  

Brittan was very pleased with the content of our revised proposal yesterday, 
and told us he would be taking the revised partnership strategy we discussed 
directly to George David, CEO.  

Brittan will also be taking the preliminary concept to UTC Corporate 
Treasury, to gain its buy in on the financing aspects of the deal required to 
support the demand side management infrastructure investments it so 
desperately needs to affect the energy  consumption reduction to which David 
committed two years ago.

Barring a problem there, it appears we have finally engaged UTC in an 
exclusive negotiating relationship that would yield a large scale outsource 
of energy supply and demand side investment operations in all the UTC 
companies, excepting Carrier.    Carrier continues to insist it be treated 
separately, and Brittan has decided to carve it out, rather than hold up the 
entire deal.  I think that strategy is part of what he will be speaking to 
David about.

I requested, and Brittan agreed, that Karl Kropic (COO) be the executive 
sponsor.

Mike Jackson who has worked on and off with UTC over the past 18 months will 
be the lead Originator for EES moving forward.","[('UTC', 6), ('Brittan', 5), ('energy', 4)]"

Rod Williams,Thanks for the Memories!,"Fri, 25 Aug 2000 00:34:00 -0700 (PDT)","Mr. Lay, I am a 59 1/2 year old employee that last saw you at my 25 year 
award celebration in Houston in 1993.  Since that time, I have had some 
health problems that are leading me to retire a little early from Enron, on 
August 31, 2000. 

 I did not want to leave Enron's active employment until I had the 
opportunity to express to you my gratitude.  I have been with Northern 
Natural Gas, InterNorth, HNG-InterNorth and Enron for thirty two years and 1 
month.  I can tell you without hesitation, that since you took over our 
company in the late 80's, it has been the most challenging and exciting time 
that I have spent in my work life.  I had opportunities that I never dreamt 
of and I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had.   I started on 
August 1, 1968 as a maintenance helper at the South Omaha location of 
Northern Natural Gas.  I was a field technician, an O&M Supervisor, a 
District Manager, and presently the Manager of the Operations Communications 
Center in Omaha.

I have admired and respected you since the first time we met in Des Moines, 
Iowa, shortly after the merger.  Without your guidance and direction and the 
many employee based programs you have initiated, I would not be where I am 
financially today.  I am looking forward to retirement without concern for me 
or my family's future.  The ESOP program was so very important to all of the 
employees, and the many other programs like our ""options"", variable pay 
(bonus) and others make Enron a leader throughout the world in employee 
satisfaction, and we have the awards to prove it.

The employees that I have worked with in these 32 years are the bright spots 
for Enron, not only in the past but also into the future.  We have done a 
wonderful job of getting the best of the best.

I hope that I will be able to thank you in person and shake your hand once 
more, perhaps at a future shareholders meeting.

Sincerely,

Rod Williams

PUBLIC HEALTH vs. THE NANNY STATE? -- Next Independent Policy Forum (10/26/00)
http://www.independent.org/tii/forums/001026ipf.html

Barely a day goes by without some news of the latest public health
""threat."" Serious health hazards, we are told, lurk around every
corner -- in water supplies, air, soil, beverages, fast food,
second-hand smoke, cellular phones, and food irradiation, just to
name a handful. And yet, Americans today live longer than ever! Are
markets and private decision-making providing the answers? Or are
these dangers real, immediate, and a legitimate mandate for
government control? Can we reduce or eliminate health risks without
government dictates? How does politics distort perceptions about
public health? Will Americans succumb to or rebel against the growing
Nanny State's neo-Puritanism and attack on individual choice and
responsibility? JACOB SULLUM and THOMAS DiLORENZO will discuss these
timely and important issues.

SPEAKERS:

SONATRACH ASK FOR PATIENCE OVER OZ2 PIPELINE CONTRACTS
Algiers - Sonatrach has asked bidders to extend until the end of 2000 offers
made for the $1bn OZ2 pipeline system, designed to extend the capacity of
the crude oil corridor from the central el_hamra oil field to the Arzew
terminal west of Algiers. The extension will allow the company more time to
evaluate the bids
About six companies/groups are understood to be bidding for the three
contracts which are estimated to be worth $220-250m each. They include CCC;
a consortium of Bonatti, with Entrepose and Dragados & Construcciones and
Bechtel. The first two contracts involve the construction of the pipelines
with a third contract for six pumping stations. The recent political changes
in Algeria, combined with internal administrative changes in Sonatrach, are
said to have contributed to the delay.


OIL PRICES RISE OVER ISRAELI CONFLICT
London - Oil prices soared on global markets last night following rising
tensions in the Middle East.
London Brent blend futures rose 72 cents to $31.48 but remains short of a
10-year high $34.98 touched last month. US light crude was up 92 cents at
$32.79 helped by speculators returning to buy oil after a two-week sell-off.
Following Saudi Arabia's warning that Riyadh and other Arab states would not
""watch with their hands tied"" if Israel attacked Lebanon or Syria, the cost
of a barrel of crude went up almost a dollar to $32.79 (o22.60) in New York.
Earlier the International Energy Agency set alarm bells ringing when it said
the West was heading into winter with inventories well below the seasonal
norm.
Oil prices have retreated from their 10-year peaks last month after pressure
from the G7 industrial nations on producers to pump more crude and the US
decision to release 30m barrels from its strategic reserve. After briefly
dipping below $30, prices have risen amid concerns that demand will exceed
supply in the coming months, particularly if the violence in Israel leads to
a broader conflict. Oil prices are seen as a threat to the prospects of low
inflation in the West, and yesterday's increases spilled over into bond
markets, where worries about Wall Street and energy shortages had already
driven yields higher.
A wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis over the past 12 days
has killed at least 90 people, mostly Palestinians.


BUY-BACK TERMS SET TO CHANGE
Tehran - In an interview with Petroleum Argus this month, Mehdi Hosseini,
former Deputy Oil Minister for international Affairs and now Managing
Director at Kala, the procurement arm of NIOC based in London, indicated
that future negotiations with foreign oil companies will take place using
more favourable terms.
NIOC is reportedly close to implementing a more attractive buy-back formula.
Since the Islamic Republic re-opened its doors to foreign oil companies in
1997, executives had quietly bemoaned the buy-back formula as offering small
capital returns on huge investments. Despite this, Iran's energy buy-back
projects have so far attracted close to $10bn capital to the Iranian energy
sector. NIOC argues that it is their duty to negotiate terms favourable to
its population rather than to foreign entities. It now appears that in the
face of increased competition for foreign investment from its Gulf
neighbours, NIOC is prepared to compromise. For further details please visit
http://www.petroleumargus.co.uk


TURKIOG' 2000 UPDATE
London - Please be advised that time is running out to register for TURKIOG'
2000 conference in Istanbul on 16th and 17th of November. The event,
supported and endorsed by the Ministry of Energy & Natural Resources, Botas,
Tupras, TPAO, Directorate of Petroleum Affairs and Petkim, has now attracted
in excess of 600 delegates according to the organisers, ITE Exhibitions. The
supporting exhibition has attracted the participation of over 100 companies,

"""Capellas, Michael D."" <Michael.Capellas@COMPAQ.com>",Disappointing news,"Fri, 25 Aug 2000 01:13:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken:

Very shortly after we spoke, I was informed that we had lost the Enron
HomePC Program. This is a great emotional blow to us and I am beyond
disappointed.

We understood that given our recent  strong performance against Dell, they
would do anything to embarrass us in our own backyard.  We have very strong
insight into their intent and knew they would  use this aggressively in
their PR campaigns.

However, clearly it was our job to win the business on the merits of the
individual program and to compete hard for it. We believed that we had a
creative offer on the table that would create great value for your
employees. Obviously, we did not perform to your expectations.

Following is the summary of our activities together which was created before
we heard the news.

I pride myself in developing strong executive relationships with our
customers, and I would welcome the opportunity for us to put our heads
together in order to look for ways we can move the relationships between our
two companies to a higher level.

I also think we should discuss the PR positioning. As a member of our Board,
and as a leader in the Houston community this will be news and I am hopeful
we can find a creative way to balance it.

Again, I accept it was ours to win in the marketplace but regret it had to
come to this. I look forward to your call.

M




From our Enron team:



* EBS Product and Service Supply Agreement

Compaq will continue to honor the Product and Service Supply Agreement
executed on January 18 between EBS and Compaq, whereby Compaq agreed to
purchase broadband services from EBS (on a take or pay basis) in proportion
to EBS' purchase of NT servers and attached storage.  It is also important
to note that we have been actively partnering with EBS on non-contractual
areas, such as our ongoing technical joint development and marketing efforts
around the Windows Streaming Media product.  I understand that our teams
have been working very closely together -- and with Microsoft -- to resolve
technical issues with Windows Streaming Media and thereby speed EBS' market
deployment.

The major issue is that Enron does not support traffic to many of our
concentration point so we need to be creative.

Bottom line, we are down to solvable problems with solution activities
underway.

* Windows 2000


During the last week of May Compaq responded to a request from Enron to
support Windows 2000 deployments, and placed people on site with no defined
contract or process due to Enron's requirements.  At this writing, no
contract has been signed, and the current contract iteration is at number
fourteen.  Apparently the delivery scope has changed several times and there
have been a few mistrals. Compaq is continuing to provide resources despite
the fact that no contract is in place and will work with Enron to ensure a
successful completion of the project.

* Power Management

Jesse Greene, our CFO, will act as the contact point for Enron for power
management services. The issue is we have existing contracts at favorable
rates but we will break the log jam.

* HomePC Program

For several months, Compaq and Enron have been working the solution to bring
technology and Internet access into the homes of every Enron employee.
There have been many creative discussions around hardware and financing to
allow Enron to fully subsidize the package provided.  Compaq, Enron and
Compaq Financial Services had gotten to a point where the $35 per month cap
was going to require the specifications of the hardware to be reduced.  In
recognition of the value of our partnership and our mutual desire for this
program to be the premier program in the industry, we have increased the
specifications of the hardware while taking significant pricing actions and
financing rate reductions.  These actions will actually allow Enron to
support better than expected hardware with the extended warranty for $34.28
per month.   This will truly be an industry-leading program when launched
later this fall.","[('Enron', 12), ('I', 9), ('Compaq', 8)]"

It is my judgement that this story and the spin  afterwards could easily 
shave 10 points off our yes #'s and make this a  horserace again.
?
It is even worse than the stealth tax increase in  '96 because it cuts to the 
heart of voters' objections to the funding of sports  facilities. And it 
takes away our reponse that this money cannot legally ever be  used to fund 
hospitals or education. This was the basis of their successful  attack in 
'99---only this time we don't have any real response.

The Chronicle has delayed this story for  one day.

Dear Mr. Lay:

Here's the newly completed Enterprise version of our white paper, and the
Service Provider version is being finished now. I'll send that along as soon
as it's ready.

After you and your associates read it, I think you'll discover that we
provide a VPN tool that eases provisioning of Nortel Contivity, Cisco IOS,
Altiga and PIX, as well as VPN management and security policy auditing. This
would compliment your existing solutions and greatly expand your ability to
penetrate the market with your product offering.

Let me know technical questions you come up with and I'll get our CTO to
answer them for you.

Subject: TBD Networks VPN Initiative


Dear Mr. Lay:

Because you were recognized Business Week in 1999  for ""taking Enron into
the red-hot communications industry"" by ""developing an intelligent network
platform to facilitate online business and building a market for trading
bandwidth"", we'd like to get your opinion on how we can contribute to your
initiative.

TBD Networks is a Secure VPN Management software company here in Silicon
Valley. We believe Enron could benefit from using our highly scalable
software to manage VPNs Enterprise-wide by:

1) Speeding up the setup and provisioning time for tens of thousands of
VPNs.
2) Uniquely Vendor-Independent: Supporting all types of VPNs (Remote
Access/Site-to-site/Extranet), based on equipment, products and technologies
from Cisco IOS, PIX, Altiga, Nortel and Check Point.
3) Reducing training and support needs by using our easy-to-use, web-based
GUI based on high-level policies, hiding low-level, vendor-specific
interfaces.
4) Providing significantly higher levels of security and control VPNs via
advanced features such as random policy auditing and proactive service
monitoring.

We would be very interested in meeting with someone at Enron to find out how
you would like to proceed. Who would you suggest we contact?

Jeffrey Sherrick,EGEP Sale Announcement,"Fri, 13 Oct 2000 08:26:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken, Jeff , Joe & Cliff,

This is a copy a note I sent to PR(Steve Kean & John Ambler), IR(Mark Koenig) 
and Enron India(Sanjay Bhatnagar & Jimmy Mogal) regarding our internal 
announcement to  EGEP/EOGIL employees in Houston and India on October 13, 
2000.


On Friday (last night Houston time) we announced to employees Enron's 
decision to sell Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our subsidiary that owns 
a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have 
bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it 
extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were numerous 
rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement 
was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston. Basically we 
said the following:
 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to 
redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has 
exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not 
envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are 
placing EOGIL in the market.
 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we 
will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron 
entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL 
transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.  
 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global 
E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001.
 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process. 
  a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process
  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale 
process
  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and 
coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development
 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told 
them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a 
PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many 
people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers 
or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with 
the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated 
March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide 
transition services to a buyer.
 
I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were 
for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in 
the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike 
Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can 
be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully briefed 
on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike will be 
traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.  I will be 
available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) 
713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.  I would suggest 
talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.

This afternoon I notified our partners and the Gov't of India of our 
intention to market our assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to 
visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two 
weeks.  While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries 
from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me.  As you might

A New Era in Taiwan's Democracy
Monday, October 23, 2000
9:00 a.m - 3:00 p.m.
Wohlstetter Conference Center
Twelfth Floor, AEI

On May 20, Taiwan entered a new era of democracy as the torch of government 
was passed from a ruling party that has governed for the past 50 years to the 
opposition.  In the spirit of cooperation and amity, the new president 
appointed a KMT member to be his premier and sought to create an ""all 
people's government"" composed of both ruling and opposition party members.  
But that experiment ended when the premier resigned on October 3 due to bad 
health.  Now, with both a DPP president and a DPP premier at the helm, Taiwan 
enters a new era of governance and party politics.  How will this impact the 
political environment in Taiwan?  Will U.S.-Taiwan relations be affected?

THE HILL REPORT
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of October 7 - October 13, 2000

This Week in Washington, we witnessed a horrific tragedy in the Middle
East. This week's situation has escalated into a sad reminder of
the sacrifice our men and women in uniform make when they report
to duty each day in service to our country. Our thoughts, prayers
and support go out to their families and to all American military
men and women serving our nation all over the world.

This is also a reminder that though we are living in an era of relative
peace and prosperity, America has enemies. There is unrest in the
world and we must be prepared to do everything in our power to find
the people responsible for this heinous act and bring them to justice
swiftly. The world's brokers of terror will know there are consequences
when America is the target of their hate. We are a peace and freedom
loving people and these actions will not be tolerated against our
soldiers or our citizens.

In the United States House of Representatives we passed both the
Defense Authorization Bill and the Agriculture Appropriations bill
for fiscal year 2001.

The Defense Authorization Act, (H.R. 4205) passed by a vote of 382-31
and authorizes $309.9 billion in new budget authority for national
defense activities in FY 2001.  In honoring our commitment to our
men and women in service, this amount is $4.6 billion more than the
Clinton-Gore Administration's request.

Overall, the conference report authorizes (1) $75.8 billion for military
personnel; (2) $110.0 billion for operations and maintenance and
working capital funds, (3) $62.9 billion ($2.6 billion more than
the president's request) for weapons procurement, (4) $38.9 billion
($1.1 billion more than the president's request) for research and
development, (5) $8.8 billion ($788 million more than the president's
request) for military construction and family housing.

I strongly supported the measure and voted for it.  The bill also
provides a much needed and much deserved 3.7 percent military pay
raise and numerous bonuses and other retention and quality of life
programs.

The Agricultural Appropriations bill that also passed this week will
help farmers and producers of livestock and dairy who are suffering
another year of weather and financial losses, including an additional
provision that lifts limits to $150,000 this crop year on Loan Deficiency
Payments (LDPs) and provides the first move to re-opening for agricultural
trade into Cuba.

On Thursday, by a vote of 340 to 75, the House approved H.R. 4461,
the Agricultural Appropriations Act, with the Senate expected to
follow within the week.

Producers suffering a series of harvest losses due to weather extremes
will be able to draw upon funding that provides as much help as possible,
by providing upwards of $1.6 billion for crops - beyond USDA's recent
$1.3 billion estimate.

A prescription drug importation measure was also included in the
bill and will become law as part of the Agriculture Appropriations
Act for Fiscal Year 2001. I hailed the measure as a victory for seniors.

This is great news for America's seniors.  I have always said that
the world's best consumers should not be paying the world's highest
prices. This week we passed a bill to change that.

Currently, seniors in Texas and across the country are paying as
much as 70% more for prescription drugs than their counterparts in
other countries. For example, in 1998, a 30-day supply of ""Prilosec""
cost about $99.95 in Texas but that same 30-day supply was a mere
$17.50 in Mexico.

I strongly support giving seniors more choices in their health care
options but warned that increased choices means increased responsibility.
 Millions of seniors wanted to be able to buy prescription drugs
from Canada and Mexico in order to save money on some drugs.  This
bill does that for them but seniors must be aware of the safety concerns
associated with getting drugs from other countries.

Around Texas...

Tomorrow, I will hold a town hall meeting in Mexia,  and following
the town hall meeting there will be a ""Cancer Society Walk for Life"".
 And next week, I will be in Bryan for a Town Hall Meeting.  See
the notices at the end of this e-mail.

October 13, 2000

This past Wednesday eveing, the cocktail party in honor of the National
Audubon Society=01,s Living Ocean, held at the home of W. Graham Arader III=
 at
1016 Madison Avenue, was a stellar event, drawing a crowd and raising
awareness.  The focus of the event was the launching of the =01&Just Ask=01=
8
campaign, aimed at protecting the creatures of the sea by expanding consume=
r
awareness about food from the ocean.  Attendees sampled delicious recipes
from some of the top US chefs, all of whom used fish recommended by the
=01&Seafood Lover=01,s Almanac,=018 a beautifully designed, whimsical guide=
 to fish
and shellfish that serves to help consumers become more familiar with the
seafood they eat.
.
Edited by Ms. Mercedes Lee (with Suzanne Iudicello and Dr. Safina
contributing), the Seafood Lover=01,s Almanac provides readers with crucial
information regarding sea life: what is safe to eat, for example, and which
species are endangered.  Many seafoods commonly available today are much
less plentiful than the average consumer might think.  Consumers hold the
greatest influence over the buying decisions of seafood wholesalers and
retailers, and with the efforts of the National Audubon Society this issue
will have a much greater chance of receiving widespread attention.

America=01,s top seafood chefs (and their spectacular creations) were in
attendance, including Rick Moonen, of Oceana, New York; Todd English,
Kingfish Hall, Boston; Jonathan Eismann, Pacific Time, Miami; Robert
Kinkead, Kinkead=01,s, Washington, D.C.; and Terence Feury, Striped Bass,
Philadelphia.  The sampling of food ranged from Margarita Oysters to
Dungeness Crabcakes with Chipotle Vinaigrette, Sesame Seared Tuna with
seaweed salad, pickled ginger, wasabe and fried wontons, all served up in a=
n
irresistible fashion.  Best of all, the chefs generously shared their
recipes to all who whished to recreate these delicious appetizers at home.

Other notable guests included Jennifer Bogo, Associate Editor for The
Environment Magazine; Barbara Fairchild, Editor and Chief of Bon Appetite;
Mindy Fox of the Earth Pledge Foundation; Jennifer Herman of Martha Stewart
Magazine; Ray Isle, Senior Editor of Wine & Spirits; James Rodewald, Senior
Editor of Gourmet; and of course, Graham Arader, a long time supporter of
the Audubon Society, who would not have missed the event for the world.

The evening was permeated by celebration and enthusiasm for the new =01&Jus=
t
Ask=018 campaign: a wonderful sign that support for the Audubon Society and=
 all
of its fundamental projects continues to grow.  Please do not hesitate to
contact us if you would like information on how you can make a contribution
to the invaluable efforts of the National Audubon Society.

My name is Cole Albon.  I work for Sigaba, a secure internet communications
company and I'd like to get you started using our technology.   We enable a
""send secure"" button in an existing email client so that your sensitive
emails can be sent across the internet in privacy.  Sigaba is extremely easy
to use and works on both internal and external company email.  I'd like you
and your executive team to start using our software.  Then, if it makes
sense for you to use our encryption solution on a company wide basis, I'd
like to present you with an enterprise solution.

Why?
- When you send an email, it is sent through several servers on the way to
its recipient.
- These servers are not owned by you or the recipient, so many people can
read the contents.
- Given your position, you probably send information that you don't want
others to read.
- Sigaba can give you the technology to protect your emails without you
changing your software or email habits.

My contact information is below and you can download our software at
http://www.sigaba.com.  If you'd like investigate further, please feel free
to contact me directly or forward my contact information to your Manager of
Network Security.

David W Delainey,ARC,"Mon, 16 Oct 2000 03:34:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern 
Gas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain 
strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of 
this proposal.  To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory 
pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis 
markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward 
characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, 
there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA 
point of view.

The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project.  
The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M.  
the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, 
venture capital and the ""organizing group"" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he 
believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million 
of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to 
participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.

ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
October 2000, Number 10


TELLING IT LIKE IT IS
Sidney Weintraub

This is my curmudgeon commentary. Its barbs are directed against 
exaggeration, double talk, and scapegoating of important institutions engaged 
in global economic development.

I do not intend, in what follows, to disparage the importance of labor unions 
in protecting the rights and benefits of workers, or to argue that the United 
States is a protectionist nation, or to doubt the valuable work that is done 
by multilateral institutions. My purpose, rather, is to highlight a few 
points: the hypocrisy that exists when imports of goods and services from 
poor countries are restricted while simultaneously insisting that this 
exclusion will benefit workers in those countries; the inconsistency of 
promoting democracy in developing countries even as we neglect the interplay 
of foreign trade, economic well-being, and political outcomes; the 
perpetuation of the fiction that multilateral institutions are independent 
actors that behave supranationally in ways that conflict with the desires of 
their powerful members; and the misconception that institutions such as the 
World Bank provide a service by promising more than they can deliver.

The leaders of organized labor in the United States opposed NAFTA and the 
grant of permanent normal trading relations with China. They are also against 
a free trade area of the Americas and opening a new round of negotiations in 
the World Trade Organization. The stated basis for this opposition is that 
the United States should not further liberalize its import structure until 
other countries accept core labor standards (right of association, power to 
organize and bargain collectively, prohibition against forced labor, minimum 
age for employment of children, and acceptable working conditions), and that 
punishment should be meted out in the form of U.S. import restrictions when 
these standards are violated.

Is this protectionism or a socially conscious initiative to upgrade labor 
conditions in poor countries? The leaders of poor countries insist that they, 
too, want to raise labor standards, but cannot do this if their export 
earnings are restricted. The practical result of the U.S. position is that 
meaningful trade negotiations are not going forward. Even though labor 
leaders insist this is not about protectionism, it sure looks like 
protectionism. (Former senator Dale Bumpers has noted that when politicians 
say something is not about money, it is about money.)

World Bank analysis has shown persuasively that the developing countries that 
have made the most progress in raising incomes are those that have opened 
their markets and engaged actively in world trade. However, there are still 
antitrade advocates who advise today's developing countries to look inward, 
just as many of today's developed countries focused first on internal markets 
and protecting their producers against foreign competitors. This was 
Alexander Hamilton's advice to the newborn United States. It was the 
development pattern for Japan. It was Ra?l Prebisch's advice to Latin 
American countries. Although this advice may have had some relevance once 
upon a time for countries with large or potentially large internal markets, 
such as Brazil, it surely does not for countries with tiny markets, like many 
in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. The lesson of post-World War II 
development history is that countries that looked outward, such as those in 
East Asia, grew rapidly, while those that looked inward, as in Latin America, 
were relatively stagnant.

Is the advice to poor countries to look inward in the modern and increasingly 
globalizing world sincere, or is it designed to prevent competition in the 
U.S. market? Why advise developing countries to emulate the world's losers 
rather than the winners?

A dominant aspect of U.S. foreign policy today is to promote democracy 
wherever this seems feasible, such as in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
East Asia, Africa, and the transition nations of the former Soviet Union. 
This is a laudable effort. At the same time, however, the most severe U.S. 
trade restrictions are directed against imports from developing 
countries-such as sugar and textile products from just about everywhere, 
orange juice from Brazil, and steel from many developed and developing 
countries alike. U.S. foreign aid now represents 0.1 percent of our gross 
national product, placing it at the bottom of the list of donor countries. 
Our slogan used to be ""trade, not aid."" Now it is more like ""not too much 
trade and very little aid.""

It is extremely difficult for poor countries to establish stable democracies. 
Achieving this obective is made even more complex by the inherent 
contradiction in U.S. policy-preaching democracy even as we limit the ability 
of these countries to obtain the resources necessary to make democracy 
possible.

During the past year much invective has been hurled at key multilateral 
institutions established at the end of World War II. This was evident in 
Seattle late last year when protesters tried to disrupt the meetings of the 
World Trade Organization (the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, which came into being in 1947), and again last month in Prague 
during the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund. It is not clear why the demonstrations were directed against these 
institutions rather than at the countries which determine the institutions' 
policies. They are not supranational bodies, but rather creatures of their 
masters, the world's most powerful national governments.

It is troubling when nongovernmental organizations exercise their right of 
free speech by preventing delegates to international meetings from exercising 
their right of free speech. We should not be troubled, however, when serious 
nongovernmental observers act constructively to change practices they find 
offensive. The IMF has long been ultrasecretive about its analyses and 
findings; this is inappropriate for an institution that obtains its funds 
from national governments (i.e., from taxpayers). The WTO's 
dispute-settlement procedures, which are an important part of that 
organization's work, have themselves been overly secretive. Many of these 
practices are changing, and the outside critics deserve much of the credit 
for this greater openness.

The president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, has exerted great effort 
to make the bank's work more transparent. At the same time, he exaggerates, 
incorrigibly so. He implies that the bank, under his leadership, has 
""discovered"" that economic growth, while necessary, is not sufficient to 
achieve widespread social development. There are many examples of this 
attitude. Only one will be cited: ""The old approach of an exclusive focus on 
growth as the elixir for all the world's problems is thus too circumscribed"" 
(op-ed by Wolfensohn and Joseph Stiglitz, Financial Times, September  22, 
1999). Wolfensohn's emphasis on alleviating poverty is praiseworthy, but the 
trashing of all the foreign aid practitioners who preceded him for not 
understanding the multiple aspects of development is egregiously inaccurate 
and ungracious.

The World Bank's World Development Report 2000/2001 is devoted exclusively to 
""attacking poverty."" It approaches this theme citing three areas for action: 
creating opportunities, empowering the poor, and providing greater security 
against the risks the poor face. The study contains a mountain of data and 
undoubtedly will be a valuable reference source for years to come. What it 
fails to do, however, is to explain how the World Bank can achieve these 
goals, particularly empowerment, which it admits depends on ""the interaction 
of political, social, and other institutional processes."" Is this the role of 
the World Bank?

Marge Nadasky,Re: Directions to Video Taping,"Mon, 16 Oct 2000 08:32:00 -0700 (PDT)","We are looking forward to having you at the video taping we are doing for the 
Management Conference.  We will be taping at Houston Studios on Thursday, 
October 19, from 4:00-6:00 p.m.  As mentioned in our earlier e-mail, we want 
the atmosphere to be comfortable, so we ask that you dress casually, or at

Please try to get there as close to 4:00 p.m. as possible -- even a little 
before would be great.  We'll have someone ready to apply a little make-up 
and get you miked.

Directions:  The studio is located at 707 Walnut Street.  To get there from 
the Enron Building, take Clay to Main Street and make a left onto Main.  Turn 
right on Texas, and left on San Jacinto.  Turn right onto Wood Street which 
will dead-end and you will have to take a left onto Walnut.  The building 
will be on your left and the entrance is located in the middle of the 
building.  There is visitor parking in the front.

The phone number of the studio is 713/223-0951.

If things change on your schedule and you cannot make the video shoot, please 
let me know as quickly as possible.  It will make a difference in how we 
frame the shot, so it's important that we have advance notice.

We look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

IMPRESSIVE LETTER FROM LIZ CHENEY PERRY



In this America of  
ours, where the passion for publicity is a disease and
where swarms of  
foolish tawdry moths dash with rapture into its consuming
fire, it was a rare  
good fortune that brought to eminence a man so reserved,
so unassuming, so  
retiring, so gracious to high and low, and so serene.&quot;
Judge Learned  
Hand in tribute to Justice Cardozo, 1938.

Here are some things America  
should know about my dad, Dick Cheney.? He
loves the mountains and  
rivers and prairies that stretch into forever in
Wyoming.? He is of the  
American West.? His handshake is firm.? He looks you
in the  
eye.? His word is his bond.? He is a world class listener, and  
when
he talks, it is always worth listening.? I have never known a wiser  
man.
To my three daughters, he is &quot;Papa.&quot;? Watching him with  
his granddaughters
is a great joy.?? My daughters are young and  
their concerns are the concerns
of little girls -- dolls and play-dough and  
first friends.? He has infinite
time for them, as he always has for my  
sister and me.? He is never rushed,
never hurried.? He is supremely  
kind, loving and patient - listening to
their latest song from school,  
reading bedtime stories, or teaching them how
to fish (a lesson Cheneys learn  
early). 
He grew up in Casper, Wyoming in the days when you could ride your  
bike out
of town and hunt rabbits on the prairie.? His dad, a World War  
II veteran,
was a career civil servant with the Soil Conservation  
Service.? His mom
worked as a secretary at Bustard's Funeral Home to  
make ends meet.? He
pitched for the local American Legion baseball  
team.? He owed much of his
skill to my grandmother, who had played for  
the Syracuse, Nebraska
Bluebirds, a nationally-ranked girls' softball  
team.? She caught his pitches
many evenings on their front lawn at 505  
Texas Place.
He was the first in his family to graduate from college.?  
He built
powerlines across Wyoming and Colorado to help pay his way.? He  
carried a
ticket for six years in the International Brotherhood of Electrical  
Workers.

He married his high school sweetheart, Lynne, in  
1964.?? One look at the
inscriptions they penned in each other's  
high school yearbooks and you know
they were as deeply in love at 18 as they  
are today.? He was the captain of
the football team and she was the  
homecoming queen.? Getting her elected was
his first political  
campaign.
There have been lots of other campaigns since then.? Despite  
his success,
he's not a typical politician.? He's not a  
glad-hander.? He's not a
fast-talker.? He's not slick.? He is  
who he is.? He is real and honest and
true.? 
He loves this  
country.? He knows how blessed we all are to be Americans.?  
He
taught my sister and me that we owe everything we have to the brave men  
and
women who died so that we could be free.? When we were young, he  
took us to
the battlefields where the Civil War was fought.? He taught  
us to love
history and to revere this great nation.???  
Serving as Secretary of Defense was the greatest honor of his life.? I  
have
heard him say that this was because of the troops, the men and women of  
the
U.S. military.? I went with him to Arlington National Cemetery the  
day of
the memorial service for the servicemen and women who died in the  
Persian

After our conversation with Gerry Hines at the Aspen Hospital my wheels
started spinning.  If you remember, you mentioned to Hines that you would
have your people contact his in reference to Enron's real estate requirement
in London.  Well, this eager (maybe too eager) real estate broker's juices
started flowing (Papa Duncan would be surprised to know that something
besides Wendy gets me going)!

If you need some quality competition, I have formed a strategic alliance
with Trammell Crow Savills (www.trammellcrowsavills.com) specifically to
pursue Enron's real estate needs in London and elsewhere in Europe.
Trammell Crow Savills was formed in May to create one of the largest and
most experienced full service real estate firms covering Europe,
Asia-Pacific and Australia.  I was able to form this alliance specifically
to go after your business because 4 of the top officers at Trammell Crow are
friends of mine.  Don Williams (Chairman), Pryor Blackwell  (COO), Chuck
Anderson (Regional President) and Mike Lafitte (President Dallas and Blake
Poston's Godfather).  In fact, Trammell Crow is hosting a golf tournament in
October that will raise $70,000 for Rise Dallas!

Mike Lafitte is the only one who knows that Enron is the potential prospect.
So, if I have my nose where it does not belong I can shut it down without
any fanfare.

Could there be an opportunity to meet with Enron to sell Trammell Crow
Savills for your London and/or European real estate needs?

It's a long shot, I know.  But, I had to take a swing!

Sincerely,

John

Subject: UTC Sales Call

At UTC's request, yesterday Mike Jackson and I met with Kent Brittan, VP, 
Global Sourcing, and members of his sourcing group.  As you remember, we 
first met Kent when Tom White, Dan Leff, Harold Buchanan and I called on him 
two years ago.  At the time, we presented an early version of a fully bundled 
energy outsource in partnership with Fluor Daniel and a local real estate 
management firm.

Over the last two years, UTC attempted various energy procurement strategies, 
failing to execute any.  

Brittan was very pleased with the content of our revised proposal yesterday, 
and told us he would be taking the revised partnership strategy we discussed 
directly to George David, CEO.  

Brittan will also be taking the preliminary concept to UTC Corporate 
Treasury, to gain its buy in on the financing aspects of the deal required to 
support the demand side management infrastructure investments it so 
desperately needs to affect the energy  consumption reduction to which David 
committed two years ago.

Barring a problem there, it appears we have finally engaged UTC in an 
exclusive negotiating relationship that would yield a large scale outsource 
of energy supply and demand side investment operations in all the UTC 
companies, excepting Carrier.    Carrier continues to insist it be treated 
separately, and Brittan has decided to carve it out, rather than hold up the 
entire deal.  I think that strategy is part of what he will be speaking to 
David about.

I requested, and Brittan agreed, that Karl Kropic (COO) be the executive 
sponsor.

Mike Jackson who has worked on and off with UTC over the past 18 months will 
be the lead Originator for EES moving forward.

Mr.Kenneth Lay
Chairman & CEO
________________

Dear Mr.Lay:

It's a pleasure to get in contact with you, in order to expose our request.

We are a Reforestation Company from Panama, members of the American Chamber
of Commerce (AMCHAM), the Spanish Chamber of Commerce and the Board of
Director of the Panamanian National Association of Reforestators and we are
constituted for four different groups, with a headquarters in Panama City,
and offices in New York and Miami, in addition to several clothing and shoes
companies in Colon Free Zone, chain of retail stores at Panama City, real
estate, etc.

At present, we have 1200 reforested hectares (1 ha = 2,47 acre) with
teakwood trees. Our program is to extend the plantations, in order to
complete 2000 hectares the next year and 4000/5000 hectares (at least), in
the next 5/8 years with the participation of new investors.

As our strategy, we have in mind to invite new investment groups to
incorporate our projects, through the formation of Joint Ventures for
develope them together, or to start new forestal projects with tropical
species apts for the panamanian type soil. The tropical species have an high
aggregate value in the international market.

Because this, we want to get in contact with your group to invite you to
invest in our forestal projects. We haven't problem with the lands and
dimension of projects.

It's very important to detail, that our project need to be for your group,
part of the environmental corporative strategy in this area (Central
America), due at Panama don't have big extension of lands.

Our company will offer, in this case, the guarantees could be necessary.

Must have in mind, all the advantages existing in Panama, which are:

- Money currency is the U.S.Dollar, which gives stability that few countries
actually have,

- Low internal costs,

- Low annual inflation, which the past 15 years has been 1,3%,

- Strategical geographic position,

- Forestal Law exempts free to tax all profits obtain in Reforestation.

If you have interest in our proposal, we will send you more information
about our company by courrier.

Please, let me know your comments about our request.

Thank you in advance for your attention, we will kindly await for your
response.

Hope to hear from you soon.

fizzled as well (it turns out that the number of uninsured has been falling=

in Texas while rising in the nation as a whole). That leaves environmental=
=20
quality, where the Vice President and his ad writers have leveled a fusilla=
de=20
of dramatic allegations about increasing pollution in Texas=02=07s cities a=
nd=20
streams.
 Environmental quality presents rich opportunities for misleading data and=
=20
rhetoric. Measuring air and water pollution involves a host of variables: o=
ne=20
can measure pollution by emissions or by the quality of the air and water,=
=20
and measurements of air and water quality depend on the placement of=20
monitors, the use of *peak* versus average levels, and adjustments for=20
population exposure and for the widely differing health and amenity effects=
=20
of different kinds of pollution. Rankings among states are much more=20
problematic than rankings of school performance or health care, because all=
=20
states that are more urbanized and industrialized have higher pollution=20
levels. Texas accounts for 60 percent of the nation=02=07s petrochemical=20
production capacity and 25 percent of oil refining, and it is the only stat=
e=20
with two metropolitan areas (Houston and Dallas-Ft. Worth) among the nation=
=02=07s=20
top ten. Measured by simple gross quantities, Texas, California, and New=20
Jersey will have *more pollution* than most other states under any=20
circumstances; the rest of us can enjoy the products without having to both=
er=20
so much with the pollution-control challenges.
 Mr. Gore=02=07s charges exploit these opportunities to the hilt, combining=
=20
misleading statistics with a few outright fabrications to create an=20
impression that bears little relationship to reality. The charges are,=20
however, easy to debunk, and it is surprising that they been reported with=
=20
little scrutiny by a media that has otherwise grown wary of the Vice=20
President=02=07s loose ways with facts.
 The Gore campaign=02=07s favorite charge is that Houston has passed Los An=
geles=20
to become *the smog capital of the United States,* *No. 1 in air pollution,=
*=20
and *the dirtiest city in the nation.* (We will ignore Democratic National=
=20
Committee Chairman Joe Andrew=02=07s claim that Houston has become *the dir=
tiest=20
city in the world,* which was evidently uttered in a fit of enthusiasm for=
=20
the latest party line.) The charge is false. According to the U.S.=20
Environmental Protection Agency, air quality in Houston is improving and is=
=20
unambiguously better than in Los Angeles, and is also better than in many=
=20
other cities.
 The Houston charge is based on 1999 city data on ambient levels of ozone=
=02=05one=20
of six *criteria* air pollutants regulated under the national Clean Air Act=
=02=05
as measured by numbers of days of *exceedences*of the EPA=02=07s national=
=20
standard. Ozone levels are highly sensitive to weather conditions, especial=
ly=20
temperature. They have been essentially flat in Houston in recent years (an=
d=20
other southern cities such as Atlanta), but they fell sharply in Los Angele=
s=20
in 1999 due to unusually cool summer weather. As a result, Houston topped L=
os=20
Angeles (and all other cities) in ozone exceedences=02=05but its air qualit=
y was=20
nevertheless better than LA=02=07s. Houston=02=07s ozone level was 10 perce=
nt higher=20
than in Los Angeles, but its particulates level was 20 percent lower=20
(particulates are the other major component of *smog,* and according to the=
=20
EPA a far more serious health risk than ozone; there is no separate measure=
=20
of *smog*). Houston did vastly better than LA for three of the four other=
=20
Clean Air Act pollutants: 63% lower for nitrogen oxides, 64% lower for carb=
on=20
monoxide, and 78% lower for lead (the cities=02=07 sulphur dioxide levels w=
ere=20
identical). While Houston was out of compliance with EPA=02=07s national st=
andard=20
for only one pollutant, ozone, LA was out of compliance for three: ozone,=
=20
particulates, and carbon monoxide.
 We hasten to add that we are comparing Houston with Los Angeles only to=20
demonstrate the falsity of Mr. Gore=02=07s allegation. If Houston is not nu=
mber=20
one in air pollution, neither is it number two or even number six (Houston =
is=20
the nation=02=07s sixth largest metropolitan area).  According to the EPA A=
ir=20
Quality Index, which aggregates levels of all six air pollutants and weight=
s=20
them according to the health risks of each, air quality in Houston is bette=
r=20
than in ten other metropolitan areas. Houston also bests ten other cities o=
n=20
a separate EPA index of ozone alone. (These data are for 1998, the most=20
recent year available; rankings for 1999 and 2000 will probably be similar.=
)
 A related charge, and particularly egregious falsehood, is Vice President=
=20
Gore=02=07s assertion that Governor Bush *made key air pollution rules in T=
exas=20
voluntary.* In 1999, Governor Bush signed two laws concerned with=20
*grandfathered* sources of air pollution. Under the Clean Air Act and almos=
t=20
all state air pollution programs, old power plants and industrial facilitie=

for old facilities. The step was praised by environmental groups and helped=

coax Mr. Gore, who had not previously confronted the problem as a legislato=

or Vice President, to propose a national program of his own for old power=
=20
plants. (Mr. Bush has also advanced a national proposal.)
 But there was a wrinkle in the Texas initiative: the law covering utilitie=
s=20
enacted mandatory standards (which will result in huge reductions in power=
=20
plant emissions over the next three years), but the law covering industrial=
=20
facilities enacted a *voluntary* compliance schedule coupled with increased=
=20
fees for noncompliance. There is legitimate disagreement over just how=20
effective the fee-incentive program will turn out to be; there have been so=
me=20
initial reductions in the first year, apparently of about 25,000 tons of ai=
r=20
pollution, but the program is too recent to estimate likely future=20
reductions. What is not in dispute is that both the *mandatory* and=20
*voluntary* prongs of the Texas program constitute an extension and=20
tightening of air pollution controls=02=05and an innovation that powerful b=
usiness=20
opposition has thwarted at the national level and in most states. Nor is it=
=20
disputed that the use of economic incentives rather than regulatory mandate=
s=20
may significantly improve the effectiveness of our environmental laws and a=
re=20
worth a try; indeed, that is precisely the approach of the Vice President=
=02=07s=20
national proposal for old utilities, which consists not of mandatory=20
standards but *voluntary* tax incentives.
 For Mr. Gore=02=05a self-described environmentalist and reformer=02=05now =
to turn on=20
the Texas reforms and describe them as having weakened existing pollution=
=20
standards (*Bush made key air pollution rules voluntary*) is an act of=20
striking mendacity. His latest campaign ad adds a particularly ruthless=20
twist: it couples the *made voluntary* fabrication with the Houston air=20
quality fabrication to produce a triple falsehood=02=05that air pollution g=
ot=20
worse in Houston because Governor Bush weakened air pollution standards.
 The Vice President=02=07s most plenary change is that, under Governor Bush=
, Texas=20
has become *last among all states in air quality,* *No. 1 in industrial air=
=20
pollution,* and *No. 3 in water pollution.* Although the Gore campaign has=
=20
occasionally relied on newspaper articles and rankings produced by=20
environmental groups, its primary and only official source for these claims=
=20
is an EPA compilation called the Toxics Release Inventory. The TRI, however=
,=20
is not a useful measure of air or water pollution and is not a measure of=
=20
environmental quality at all. Instead, it measures *releases* of certain=20
substances that the EPA classifies as toxic=02=05and *releases* includes no=
t only=20
those that pollute the air and water but also those that are properly=20
disposed of through EPA-approved hazardous waste management and water=20
treatment practices. The agency=02=07s annual TRI reports warn that its est=
imates=20
*reflect releases and other waste management activities of chemicals, not=
=20
exposures of the public to those chemicals,* and that they are not sufficie=
nt=20
to determine exposure or harm to the environment or public health.
 So the TRI numbers cannot possibly support Mr. Gore=02=07s assertions. But=
 even=20
in their own terms, they tell a story that is the opposite of what the Vice=
=20
President would like voters to believe. Texas has always been near the top =
of=20
the various TRI ratings, reflecting the state=02=07s huge share of national=
=20
petrochemical and refining capacity. But it did not become No. 1 in the=20
overall ranking under Governor Bush, as the Gore campaign insinuates. Rathe=
r,=20
Texas was No. 1 under Mr. Bush=02=07s predecessor, Democratic Governor Ann=
=20
Richards, and it has improved significantly since he took office. The EPA=
=02=07s=20
1999 release of TRI data through 1997 noted that *Texas, the state with the=

largest production-related waste managed in 1997, was also the state=20

1995=20
(the first year of Mr. Bush=02=07s governorship) and 1998. The new report a=

finds Texas leading all other states in energy recovery and waste treatment=
,=20
and second in on-site recycling. Due in part to these improvements, Texas h=

 Environmental quality in Texas has improved under Governor Bush according =

MAYOR VERA KATZ, COMMISSIONER ERIK STEN PRESENT HOLISTIC APPROACH TO
ADDRESSING HOMELESS ISSUES
Reaffirming their commitment to providing safe, affordable housing while
standing firm against homeless camping in the City of Portland, Mayor Vera
Katz and Commissioner Erik Sten held a news conference today to announce
their holistic approach to address homeless and housing issues.   The two
focused on the City's ongoing efforts to preserve and create more affordable
housing, the current tools available to continue enforcing anti-camping
laws, and announced an expanded partnership with JOIN -- a private
organization that does outreach to homeless people.

""While I am still a firm believer in the need for the anti-camping ordinance
to prevent unsafe and unsanitary campgrounds, this has given us the
opportunity to take a closer look at what we in the City are doing to
provide housing and shelter opportunities for everyone,"" said Katz, ""and
while we've made strides meeting our affordable housing commitments, there
is still more we can do.""

Katz and Commissioner Erik Sten announced their intent to follow the
recommendation of Sten's 0-30% Housing Resources Task Force to spend $3.5
million of the $5 million allocated for affordable housing this coming year
on housing for those in the 0-30 percent median income range.  Over the last
seven years, the City of Portland has committed nearly $270 million towards
affordable housing, in addition to foregoing $10.5 million in revenue
through tax abatements.

""Homelessness is an issue that should be addressed by first dealing with the
individual at a personal level,"" said Commissioner Sten.  ""I appreciate that
the City is continuing to move forward on doing this with aggressive efforts
around things such as housing and outreach services.""

Katz and Sten also noted recent successes in meeting affordable housing
needs, including the Portland Development Commission's just-completed
purchase of the Fountain Place apartment building and the recent opening of
Ritzdorf Court which completed the Shelter Reconfiguration Plan.  The
Fountain Place acquisition -- completed just last Friday, means the city
will save the building's affordable housing rates, and serve as potential
replacement housing for nearby low-income units soon to be lost.

Additionally, Katz and Sten also announced an expanded partnership with JOIN
-- an outreach group that works to connect the homeless with services.

The Bureau of Housing and Community Development plans to increase JOIN's
current contract with the bureau to a total of $90,000.  This money,
combined with a new $80,000 contribution from the Portland Police Bureau,
will increase the number of JOIN outreach workers, enabling them to work in
every precinct to link homeless people with housing assistance resources.

""It is critical that we find ways for all of us to work together to help
homeless people find their way off the streets -- that means our outreach
workers, police, ODOT, and neighbors all collaborating to make that happen,""
said Rob Justus, Executive Director, JOIN.  ""Our ultimate goal is to respond
to homelessness and address the negative effect of hundreds on the streets
by helping people into housing.  By engaging the homeless people where they
are -- whether it's under a bridge or in an alleyway -- our outreach workers
can help them begin that transition off the streets.""

At the same time, Katz and Sten said that the City's aggressive efforts to
preserve and create affordable housing opportunities and to link homeless
individuals to those opportunities, made it all the more reasonable to
continue to enforce the City's anti-camping policy which prevents unsafe and
unhealthy campsites from degrading neighborhood livability.  Both said they
are pleased the Multnomah County District Attorney has decided to appeal
Judge Stephen Gallagher's opinion that the City's Homeless Camping Ordinance
is unconstitutional.

While the City Attorney's Office and DA's Office continue to analyze the
implications of the Gallagher opinion, Portland Police Bureau Assistant
Chief Bruce Prunk outlined alternative tools the City intends to use to
continue its efforts to restrict homeless camping in public areas.

1. Parks -- City Code closes most City parks between midnight and 5
a.m., others, such as Forest Park, close earlier.  After closure, people
camping would be subject to state law prohibition on criminal trespass in
the second degree, and police could issue citations and/or remove people for
trespassing.  The City also has the ability to exclude people from City
parks for a period of not more than 30 days.  Permanent or temporary
structures or facilities are also prohibited by City Code at all times, so
police could issue citations or remove people violating the ordinance as an
unclassified misdemeanor.

2. Highway Overpasses -- Oregon Department of Transportation property
under I-5 and I-405 overpasses are posted with ""No Trespassing"" signs, which
means police could issue citations to anyone camping at those locations.

3. Sidewalks -- There are provisions of the City Code that prohibit
sidewalk obstructions.

4. Parking -- City Code prohibits parking a recreational vehicle in the
public right of way directly across from a residential, public park, church
or school property unless the vehicle is being loaded and unloaded for a
period not to exceed eight hours.  In addition, no vehicle may park on the
public right of way or other public property in excess of 24 hours without
City permission.  If so, the vehicle may be removed.

Prunk said the Police Bureau would continue to work with the partners
currently in place, such as JOIN, noting that recent efforts have focused
less on anti-camping citations, and more on trespassing violations.

The Power Company Name Recognition - Introduce Home Coupons

Make the internet profitable to households.  Newspapers advertise that this 
week's Sunday paper has coupons that will save you $100.00.

Go one step better:

Every household must eat.  Some households buy the Sunday newspaper just for 
the coupons to purchase.  Offer a Enron site where producers can post 
manufacturer's coupons on The Enron B2B web page.  If the consumer downloads 
the coupon, TPC records the transaction including the consumer's logon site 
and Zip Code.  Sell the database to the manufacturer/producer.  Ask the 
consumer if they would like direct solicitations for competitor's brand.  
Expand it to appliances and manufacturer's coupons.

Then Link local grocery/appliance stores, for the consumer, by his 
surrounding zip code.  The stores would post their price for that month's 
coupon by store zip code on the B2B.  For those stores participating, prepare 
a comparison by store also considering double and triple coupon offers and 
the consumer can make a decision where to buy their groceries.  Sell the 
download to stores for expected inventory control.

DEFECTIVE TIRES, DEFECTIVE BUREAUCRACY

Some fans of the regulatory state believe that NHTSA, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, deserves much credit -- and,
in reward, expanded powers -- for its role in exposing the Firestone
tire/ Ford Explorer fiasco. But although NHTSA received early reports
of fatalities caused by the separation of Firestone tires, its
investigation began very recently -- last May -- long after
investigations by State Farm Insurance, the Center for Auto Safety,
and Safety Forum brought the problem to light.

This isn't the first time that NHTSA has failed its mission, argues
Michael I. Krauss, law professor at George Mason University and
author of the recent Independent Institute book FIRE AND SMOKE:
Government, Lawsuits and the Rule of Law.

""NHTSA, the agency responsible for minimum fuel economy standards
(found by a court to have likely cost many lives by forcing
manufacturers to produce light, dangerous cars) and for
illegal-to-disable, baby-killing airbags, does not deserve to be
rewarded for its asleep-at-the-switch approach to the tire problem,""
Krauss wrote recently.

It would be absurd to reward Firestone for selling defective tires.
However, when NHTSA fails, self-proclaimed ""consumer advocates"" call
for a parallel absurdity: lavishing the agency with more regulatory
authority and taxpayer funds. But NHTSA's pattern of failure
indicates a systemic problem -- a design flaw -- that cannot be
easily repaired. In contrast, as the Firestone episode demonstrates,
the watchful eyes of the American economic and legal systems have
enormous incentives to detect and report product defects. In this
light, perhaps what most needs to be recalled and held accountable
for sloppy workmanship and false advertising is: the defective
regulatory state.

For more information, see ""The Feds Eye Firestone,"" by Michael Krauss
(The Washington Times, 9/22/00), at

PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS ON THE WAR ON CRIME

Election-year promises always renew the risk that peaceful Americans
will see their rights sacrificed for the sake of political
expediency. This is especially true when politicians promise to ""get
tough on crime,"" as syndicated columnist and Independent Institute
research fellow Paul Craig Roberts pointed out recently.

Although one ""anti-crime"" bill (or ""anti-privacy"" according to its
critics) was recently defeated, another ""anti-crime"" bill -- this one
strengthening asset forfeiture laws -- has just been introduced.
Unfortunately, says Roberts, asset forfeiture laws violate due
process and are any easy way for politicians to look ""tough on crime""
even though such laws harm innocent Americans far more than criminals.

""The House Judiciary Committee led by Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has
documented the most extraordinary abuses of the asset forfeiture
laws,"" writes Roberts. ""The Banking Committee and [the bill's author]
should sit down with Hyde and listen carefully before they create any
more Gestapo powers for law-enforcement officers.""

MEDICARE REFORM: Economics versus Politics

Debates over Medicare reform didn't start with Al Gore and George W.
Bush. In fact, legislation similar to Medicare had been intensely
debated since the mid-1940s. However, its advocates found no way to
overcome opposition until 1965, when Medicare's staunchest advocate
on the House Ways and Means Committee found the opportunity to
smuggle Medicare legislation into another bill at the last minute.

Yet as vocal as debates over Medicare have been, very little of that
debate has been informed by sound economic principles. This omission,
which has stalled any genuine reform of Medicare, is largely the
fault of economists, says economist Robert B. Helms in the new issue
of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW.

""My criticism is not directed to the economists who have attempted
for many years to apply market principles to health-care issues, but
to the larger number of economists who have not,"" Helms writes.
""Moreover, my criticism pertains to the failure of economists to
teach the fundamental principles of economics to educated Americans,
rather than to the failure of 'economics.'""

To improve the quality of the debate over Medicare, Helms recommends
three measures. First, more economists must explain to policymakers
and the public that that market competition in health care, as in
other markets, would improve quality of health care. Second, they
must explain that competition would also make health care more
efficient by allocating scarce resources to higher-valued uses.
Finally, they must explain that price controls and destructive of
these desirable ends.

Without a concerted effort to impart these principles to a wider
audience, Helms argues, Medicare reform -- and other necessary
health-policy reforms -- will become victim of political maneuvering,
much to the detriment of the lives and well-being of the American
public.

""This lack of education in economics is appallingly evident in
Washington, D.C., especially on Capitol Hill,"" says Helms.

Politics"" by Richard B. Helms (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2000), at

John Sherriff,Atlantic Copper,"Wed, 18 Oct 2000 02:01:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken - I thought I would give you a quick update on our conversations 
regarding Atlantic Copper.  Our team met with the senior management from 
Atlantic Copper last week in concert with the London Metal Exchange Week.

There are several hurdles to overcome in structuring a deal to acquire 
Atlantic Copper and a long term copper concentrates supply from FM's 
Indonesian mine complex.   Current contract prices for copper smelting and 
refining capacity are low and they might be a bit unrealistic on price.    We 
suggested a conceptual structure that may work but is 
probably a long shot at this time.   They were interested and requested a 
more definitive proposal, which we will develop this week.

We will keep you posted.

Cindy Stark,MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING,"Wed, 18 Oct 2000 07:13:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken:

Enron Transportation Services Company (ETS) and El Paso Gas Pipeline Company 
(El Paso) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to jointly 
analyze and develop an Alaskan Natural Gas Pipeline Project (tentatively 
named North Star Pipeline).  Both parties did not want to press release the 
MOU.

The MOU only commits us to jointly study, evaluate and fund a project 
proposal.  It can be canceled at any time, for any reason, and is not an 
exclusive.

The ""Alaskan Producers"" are telling us they want to team-up with someone who 
can help them get the gas to the markets.  Four (4) Bcf of incremental 
supplies just cannot be directed to a market hub...i.e., Chicago, for 
instance.

Our goal with El Paso is to develop a joint market assessment of where the 
demand for incremental supplies is needed and then develop a total project 
that would get the gas to the various markets.

Our ownership of NNG, TW and NBPL and El Paso's ownership of ANR, El Paso and 
Tennessee will cover a lot of impacted pipelines.

I believe our best bet as of now is not to commit to a specific route or 
project (i.e., Hoglund's), but work with the producers on a total delivery 
system...wellhead to city gate/burner tip.

Your thoughts would be appreciated before we move too far in this direction.

Stan

P.S.  My guess is we would look at a 10% to 15% interest in a project 
financed (75%) pipeline.

Rob,

In our earlier meeting with Lay, he seemed to want to talk about changes in
the corporate ""visions"" over time. He also seemed interested in exploring the
idea of corporate culture. Both of these themes can be included under the
broad heading of strategic vision and the creation of a corporate culture
capable of pursuing that vision.

Specific questions are more difficult to imagine at this point. I think we
should rely on the general approach taken with Skilling and Sutton: How were
the various ""visions"" that have guided Enron's development been defined? How
were they achieved? What do you see as the key issues that should be
addressed in our history?  Who are the crucial ""cluster"" of people to
interview for each issue? How do you see this project being used within Enron?
I'll bet we can have a very productive hour with these general questions.

[Compaq Confidential - Internal Use Only]

Worldwide Sales & Services team:

My travel report this month spans the Americas - from our operations in
Latin America to those in Canada.  I had many opportunities to visit with
our sales and services employees as well as customers, partners, press and
analysts.  It's really great to have a role that brings me into regular
contact with employees and our external audiences - it's very exciting to
see how the momentum is building around the Corporation.

Latin America has been very successful in its direct and partner
initiatives, particularly in Argentina, where we are now 55% direct, and
Brazil which has 60% direct business.  Our LA e-Business Development team is
making tremendous strides to strategically position our business in the fast
growing Internet space, while opening up new and exciting revenue streams.
In just four months of existence, the team has completed several new
alliances with companies investing in the huge growth potential of the
Internet in the region.  Key alliances in this exciting new ""ecosystem""
include:

Diveo, a provider of integrated hosting and security services, secures
Compaq's position as preferred vendor for this potentially huge customer.
It also allows us to offer critical enabling services that will accelerate
the adoption of the Internet and many valuable services in the region.

We entered a strategic alliance agreement with Artikos, a joint venture
between Commerce One and Banamex, the largest bank in Mexico.  The terms of
the alliance permit Compaq to sell the Commerce One solution to the many
off-line and on-line companies investing in B2B marketplaces.  It also
positions us to participate as strategic partners in new marketplaces being
formed by established brick-and-mortar players.

Our strategic alliance with Terra, a leading regional portal, has begun to
generate exciting new revenue streams stemming from a customer
acquisition/traffic arrangement using our Presario keyboard buttons.  In
just four months of operation, we successfully sent 12 million visitors to
the Terra portal and gained from traffic and revenue sharing arrangements
that form part of the alliance.

Patagon.com - Our first Internet alliance, at a time when few, if any,
companies recognized the Internet's potential in Latin America, continues to
pay important dividends.  Patagon.com has grown to become the leading
financial portal in LA with the help of Compaq technology.  We also are
helping sustain Patagon's growth in the market through a revenue generating
traffic alliance that links our customers to Patagon's portal through our
easy access keyboard buttons.

In the coming months, you will surely be hearing more about these and other
new alliances that are transforming Compaq into a leading e-business in the
region.

Canadian highlights
My trip north yielded not only relief from the Texas heat, but also many
other great examples of progress that contributed to our Q2 results.  As you
probably know, David Booth, a 13-year veteran with Compaq and Digital, was
named President and Managing Director of our Canada operations in May.  In
Q2, the region increased their profits by 88% over Q299 and helped return
CPCG to profitability.  Earlier this year, Compaq Canada launched eStore
operations, and with other direct enhancements, expects to be 85% direct by
the end of this year.  Their Consumer Call Centre is racking up awards too -
both as Compaq Call Center of the Year, and from Call Center Magazine as the
High Technology Call Center of the Year.  Product awards in Canada include:
 - ProLiant server received Computer Dealer News' 2000 Reseller
Choice Award
 - Deskpro PC received ChannelLine Magazine's 2000 ChannelLine
Champs Award
 - Aero/iPAQ Pocket PCs became the first monitoring devices for
diabetes in the world through Charles H. Best Diabetes Centre

And last, but certainly not least, some great wins:  Banque Nationale, $2.1M
for Himalaya systems and services; Province of New Brunswick, $2M for MS
Exchange; Capital Health Region, $2M Deskpro/Armada PCs; Lotto Quebec, $1.5M
for Himalaya systems; CanJet, $1.5M for ProLiant servers; SoftChoice, $800K
for SANs; Ontario Lottery Corporation, $800K ProLiant servers; University of
Toronto, $790K Alpha Cluster; SaskTel, $700K Deskpro PCs; and Atlantic
Health Science Centre,  $500K AlphaServer systems
.

World's fastest and most powerful supercomputer
Today we are announcing that the U.S. Department of Energy's National
Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has selected Compaq to build the
world's fastest and most powerful supercomputer, a 30+ TeraOPS system
code-named ""Q.""  The contract is valued at more than $200M, and the
supercomputer will be housed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los
Alamos, New Mexico.  The supercomputer will support NNSA's integrated
program of surveillance, experiments, non-nuclear tests, archived data,
modeling and simulation to assess and certify the safety, security and
reliability of nuclear weapons without underground nuclear testing.

The supercomputer will consist initially of some 375 AlphaServer GS320
systems (approximately 12,000 Alpha processors) with EV68 CPUs running in
excess of 1,250 MHz on our Tru64UNIX operating system.  Almost the size of
five basketball courts (more than 21,000 square feet), the system will have
more than 600 terabytes of Compaq StorageWorks storage, and receive onsite
24x7 service and support.  This major win, plus other recent wins (see
National Science Foundation below) are expected to establish Compaq as the
No. 1 provider in the high performance technical systems and servers
marketplace before the end of this year.  A great recognition for Compaq,
the Business Critical Server Group, and the outstanding sales teams!

Our other largest wins this month were:
Alcatel Telecom (France) - $60M global upgrade for billing system based on
AlphaServers running Tru64 UNIX-based NECTAR middleware.  Alcatel builds
next-generation networks in more than 130 countries
BMC Software (U.S.) - Beat Dell and HP for a $13 M desktop, portable and
Professional Workstation contract
The Cabinet Office (U.K.) - Beat Logica and Admiral for a five-year, $32M
contract in which we were named prime contractor to design, build and

International Data Corp:  Compaq 'on the up'
If you haven't seen the recent study by IDC, titled Compaq's Strategy: Past
and Future, it's recommended reading
<http://weblib.lkg.dec.com/IDC/JP84G.htm>.  It states simplification, a
customer-centric approach, information access products and a clarified
channel strategy are keys to Compaq's comeback.  Preliminary 2Q market share
figures from IDC also confirm our progress in a number of other key areas.
For example:
 * Compaq led the WW PC server market with 30.2%, more than the
No. 2 (Dell) and No. 3 (IBM) vendors combined
 * We ranked second in WW portables, with 12.8%, up 2.2 points
Q/Q
 * In Japan, we moved up to No. 7 position, past Apple, in
total PCs, and regained our No. 2 server position from Fujitsu-Siemens, with
a 13.5% share
 * In Asia Pacific, we passed HP in desktops, moving up to No.
4
 * And according to DataQuest, EMEA achieved the No. 1 Consumer
ranking in Western Europe with a 13.4% share, growing twice as fast as the
market
For more information about the preliminary market share results of 2Q, or
our final results in 1Q, check the links at

Winning news from Global Accounts
Our Global Accounts team not only wins new business, but also accolades for
its videos and CDs that are used to help win business.  Trophies include two
at the AXIEM (Absolute Excellence in Electronic Media) Awards in the U.S.,
and the Telly Awards for non-network broadcasts, comparable to a U.S. TV
show winning an Emmy.

Service Provider/.com wins
Data Return, a leading global provider of advanced managed hosting services,
was recognized by Microsoft as ""Global Hosting Partner of the Year"" during
the Fusion 2000 Awards Banquet. The award noted Data Return's ongoing work
with the Windows 2000 team in developing managed hosting solutions for
customers whose applications are based on the Microsoft platform. This
represents a tremendous win for Compaq as well, since Data Return is using
Compaq hardware and services exclusively for its hosting services.

On July 31st, Compaq, Microsoft, Digex and IDC launched a series of Webcasts
to help educate Compaq Field Sales and the Compaq/Microsoft Channel. The
series, presented by a top IDC analyst, emphasized the tremendous market
opportunity within the ASP market. Based on the overwhelming participation
and positive feedback, there is a strong interest in learning more about the
ASP market. The second in the series will be presented September 7. To
register, call 800-289-0579 (outside US 719-457-2550).

Coconut.com, an ASP in the UK initially offering mail and messaging, has
named Compaq its key partner.  The solution, heavily leveraged around our
Professional Services capability, is Alpha and StorageWorks running
Software.com's suite of carrier-grade mail and messaging products.  The
infrastructure will be managed by eBMS.  HP had been working on this for 18
months, and Compaq got engaged the day before they were about to sign the
deal.  Seven weeks later HP was told they had lost the opportunity.  The key
to our success was a partnering approach to help them with their business,
not just to sell them tin.  The near-term opportunity is $5M, with up to
$25M over 5 years.  Congratulations to the UK team!

Great Compaq Financial Services deals
Supply Access - CFS is providing a $6.5M financing facility on Alpha and NT
servers for this service provider, owned by En Point, one of Compaq's
largest resellers in California.  The deal, which displaced HP and HP
Finance, includes a two-year exclusivity agreement.

Avantel - CFS also completed a $3.5M deal to refresh the installed base of
Avantel's existing Compaq desktops and servers in Mexico.  While Avantel is
a longtime Compaq customer, the inclusion of Compaq Financial Services
enabled a complex sale and lease back arrangement for the acquisition of
Compaq equipment, with opportunities for ongoing contact with the customer.

Roundup of Storage news
As you may have noticed from the earnings news, the Storage Product Group
had a strong Q2, with profitability of $179M, up 45% from last year.  SPG
delivered 11.8% of Compaq's net sales, 17.8% of total gross margin, and a
whopping 31.6 % of Compaq's operating income. Other news from the Storage
front includes:
 * A SANworks print ad campaign, directed at corporate CIOs,
started on July 10th and will be running for several weeks. The ads direct
customers to a Web companion page for more information, go to
<http://www.compaq.com/sanworks>.
 * On August 22, Compaq will open a new Enterprise Storage
Customer Center (ESCC) in Colorado Springs, Colo., that will develop and
qualify advanced network storage technologies for complex enterprise
environments and offer training for IT professionals. The Center will
complement the new Storage Networking Technology Center that was announced
earlier this spring by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA)
and is currently being constructed by Compaq.  Both centers will be housed
under one roof when the SNIA center opens later this year.
 * The Storage Networks Solutions Business Unit, focused on
providing leading-edge solutions to the industry, has created a Business
Development Team. For more information, contact Frank Orlando, who leads the
team.

Zero Latency and other BCSG attention-getters
What debuted 10 months ago at Telecom99 as a riveting demonstration of
Compaq's first Zero Latency Enterprise (ZLE) technology has matured into a
formal go-to-market program that will be launched and rolled out in October.
Its goal?  To help you identify ZLE opportunities and win deals.  The
Business Critical Server Group (BCSG) has established the ZLE Initiative to
encompass all of our enterprise offerings - Himalaya; AlphaServer with Tru64
Unix and OpenVMS; and ProLiant with Windows NT, as well as storage, clients
and services.  It will differentiate Compaq in the marketplace, generate
momentum for the company, and give us ""first-to-market"" status.  No other
competitor can come close to what we offer.  The typical ZLE deal profile is
high-revenue - $15M per deal - and high-margin, so the payoff is great.
Stay tuned for announcements in October, including info on ZLE customers;
cool new offerings incorporating platforms, partners and services; new
demos; go-to-market tools to help you tell the ZLE story; ZLE expertise to
assist with your accounts; and press and analyst proof points to help you
sell.  I encourage you to learn more about ZLE so you can leverage its
revenue potential.  For more information, contact your BCSG region drivers.

Other highlights from BCSG:
 * Congratulations to the Tandem BU for its Q2 performance, the
second highest in revenue for the BU in Compaq history.  In addition, the
S74 series had the fastest ramp in the history of the Himalaya platform,
with $69M in S74000 processors shipped since its May launch.
 * MUZO, a Czech payment authorization agency and long-time
customer, will migrate to the most powerful of the Himalaya servers, the
S74000, for its new authorization center opening in 1Q01.  MUZO provides
ATM/POS authorization and back-office services using Base24 from partner
ACI.  The order is important for Compaq in the Czech Republic because it
positions the platform firmly in the country and demonstrates the success of
the ongoing efforts of the Czech subsidiary to build local Himalaya
resources and skills.
 * The ""Dream Machine"" roadshow, which showcases the
AlphaServer GS160 server running OpenVMS Galaxy, is starting its North
American tour. One of its first stops was in Boston in late July, where it
received an enthusiastic response from the Compaq Board of Directors.
 * Recently named a partner for Oracle's iHost applications
hosting initiative, Nupremis is the first service provider to announce that
it will host Oracle iHost applications on AlphaServers running Tru64 UNIX in
its data centers to provide the most scalable and highly available platform
for e-business.

Great things happening in the Consumer world
* In 1Q, Compaq surpassed Packard Bell as the US installed base market
share leader for the first time, according to Media Metrix.  The number of
Compaq PCs in US homes has increased 260% to 5.4 million from 1997 through
1Q.
* Presario portable PCs maintained their No. 1 U.S. retail sales share
in June for the 22nd consecutive month, according to NPD Intelect
* The Presario 1200XL-110 was rated a Best Buy and No. 1 Budget
notebook by PC World magazine
* The Presario 1800T was rated the No. 5 Power notebook by PC World
magazine
* Compaq's 2Q consumer PC sales in Malaysia were up over 1,200%, due
largely to Compaq's kiosk strategy there.  The kiosks have been successful
enough to be featured in the Far East Economic Review
* Compaq beat out four other PC manufacturers to partner with
specialty retailer Eddie Bauer on special edition Presario 1400 series
portable PCs

Joint news from Consumer and CPCG
By now I'm sure you've read about the exciting new additions to the iPAQ
family of products and services, announced jointly by Mike Larson and Mike
Winkler in New York on August 15.  The announcement symbolizes the growing
convergence of the commercial and consumer markets, and the mutual desire
for information and Internet access by our customers.

In addition, CPCG deserves special congratulations on their outstanding 2Q
results - returning to profitability one quarter ahead of what was expected!
All regions were profitable, contributing to the total $63M in operating
profit.  The group achieved the best portable shipment quarter on record,
shipped the 100,000th iPAQ desktop, and the iPAQ Pocket PC demand is 10
times the initial forecast!  And by the looks of all the commercial products
wins listed in this report, the momentum is continuing.  For an interesting
Q&A by CNET News.com with Mike Winkler on the group's achievement, see:
<http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-201-2375731-0.html>

New ISSG product announcements and recognition
ISSG has been busy with a lot of new product announcements, including the
industry's first high-performance network attached server appliance, the
TaskSmart N-Series, new clustering solutions for SCO, Oracle and Microsoft.
More news includes:
 * The ProLiant 8500 is now Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 Best Performance
on the TPC-C top 10 list.  The Compaq Benchmarks result in a Price/tpmC that
is approximately $10 lower than the top marking IBM number and is using SQL
Server 2000 instead of DB2.  We even pushed the Sun 10000 off the top 10
list.
Check out the great review and double awards for the ProLiant DL360 by
InternetWeek Magazine, titled, ""Rack 'Em Up.""
<http://www.internetwk.com/reviews00/rev071700.htm>

Compaq dominates Commerce One's Global Trading Web portals
Not only do we power C1's own MarketSite.net U.S. portal and all its hosted
installations, but we also power an overwhelming number of its major portal
partners.  These include NTT in Japan, which recently replaced its 30 Dell
servers with Compaq, and Cable and Wireless (Optus) in Australia, that,
after major firmware problems with Dell, is also switching to Compaq.  Let's
be bold about stating our dominance in this market - especially when
pitching prospective business with other trading exchanges.  I'm sure
Michael Capellas won't hold back when keynoting at C1's eLink Conference in
Las Vegas next month where we'll demo our Hosting Internet Buying Program
and BuySite and MarketSiteTM solutions.

Subject:  Invitation to deliver 2001 IAEE conference keynote


Dear Ken:

Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the
International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the
annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We
invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon
on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this
event.

Our theme is ""2001: An Energy Odyssey."" We are using the conference to
showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to
deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as
enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to
clearly define these major themes and priorities than you.

I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in
Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that
the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points
to
heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the
opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of
vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include
comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both
guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in
markets on behalf of enterprises.

The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business
and
university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring
you
up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure
Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together
for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston
conference
(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In
addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of
RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues
and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a
joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology
Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.

Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate
sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,
which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to
help
identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary
session, ""Sustaining Development"" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn
thinking around with our re-phrasing).

I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We
look forward to having you with us next April!

This week:

THE LAST MILE TO ... SOMEWHERE?
By Tim Laseter, Martha Turner, Anne Chung, and Pat Houston

New York, Oct 17, 2000- Last week's announcement that the Web-based e-tailer 
and delivery service Urbanfetch was discontinuing its business-to-consumer 
operation came as no surprise to us. As we pointed out in the August issue of 
strategy+business, such companies -- highflyers Kozmo.com, Webvan, and 
HomeGrocer among them -- face limited online sales potential, high cost of 
delivery, a speed-variety trade-off, and existing, entrenched competition. 
""We believe the last mile may lead to the gallows rather than to the promised 
land,"" we wrote.

Since that article appeared, Webvan acquired HomeGrocer, Kozmo cancelled its 
plans for an initial public offering, and Urbanfetch closed its core 
business. Are we gloating over our prescience? Not at all. We think all these 
moves are signs of maturity -- and indications that one or more players may 
develop a winning business model.

Rob Bradley,Economics Study on Proposed Houston SIP--Preliminary Results,"Thu, 19 Oct 2000 05:53:00 -0700 (PDT)","You might mark your calendar for a lunch (12-1:30) at the Hyatt downtown on 
Wednesday December 13 where Barton Smith of UH and George Tolley of the U. of 
Chicago will present the findings of their economic study.  The Houston Forum 
event will be part of the Kenneth L. Lay Lecture Series in Global Economics 
at the University of Houston.  (I will have a table for Enron.)

The authors presented their preliminary results to us this week, and the 
total benefits of the planned ozone reduction (all SIP measures as currently 
proposed) are below $100 million (we are indoors most of the time that bad 
air days are occurring since it is typically very hot), and the costs are 
around $5 billion out to 2010.   Lots of caveats to this conclusion including 
the assumption of today's best technology but no more.  The high costs 
include a ""last mile"" problem that the proposal of the Partnership's Business 
Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) avoids (such as no noon-to-midnight 
construction, a 75% average point source reduction to allow for trading and 
future permits instead of a 90% reduction, etc.).

The effect on Houston is to reduce our forecast economic growth but not 
eliminate it.  Real wages are forecast to fall by some 5% or more under the 
current SIP versus without it.  Total job loss will be over 100,000--about a 
1 and a half years of growth out to 2010.   This ""shock"" will be around 
one-half of what Houston went through after the oil price crash in 1986 
according to Dr. Smith.  One might say that slower growth and spreading the 
pollution around (some of our refinery/petrochemical growth going elsewhere) 
is not the end of the world, however, if a more cost-effective SIP is chosen.

It will be several weeks before the results are final (and the election 
over), at which time an executive summary will be released.  The Mayor's 
office and TNRCC will be briefed first.  The luncheon will be the formal 
unveiling of the study with explanation, but I expect press coverage of the 
study next month.

As head of the economics working group, I have tried to ensure that a 
top-notch analysis was done without an industry bias.  The results are 
considered conservative by the authors all things considered and in line with 
the peer-reviewed literature on costs and benefits.  The study is not 
intended to be a ""whining"" study but to give us realistic expectations and to 
(naturally) bring into review some ""last mile"" problems where certain SIP 
measures are the least cost effective.

These preliminary results are confidential given the political cycle we are 
in and should not be shared externally.

Thanks. Everything is good. Our four day tracking  poll (we are tracking

?
Sylvia will hold a news conference on Tuesday to  endorse the arena. The 
press advisory sent out today will cause many of them to  think she is going 
to oppose the arena. That's good because more of the media  will show up.
?
Her basic statement will be to reinforce her  position, as the city's fiscal 
watchdog, that this will not take one dime away  from basic services and will 
indeed help the city keep growing and thus have  more funding for city 
services---especially the $13 million a  year that the Arena will generate in 
sales taxes and the increase in property  values downtown.
?
It will be great if Mr. Lay could show up at the  event and that Sylvia for 
her support and objective analysis of the arena  benefits.","[('city', 3), ('arena', 3), ('Sylvia', 2)]"

I was talking yesterday to David Thompson, President & C.E.O. of Cominco Ltd 
(Cominco Ltd is a large Canadian Zinc Producer with mines and smelters and 
have power plants).

He is very interested in some of Enron's innovative financial structures 
having seen the Enron Networks prospectus.

I'm sure a call from you would help describe some of these structures and 
give him the further confidence that his friends at Enron Metals are able to 
work with the whole resource of Enron and provide solutions to some of his 
current corporate structural dilemma's

His address and numbers are:-

For your further information we have met with Robert Adkerson, President of 
Freeport and are working a deal
with him and his colleagues to  structure a deal around their Spanish Copper 
Business.

Thanks for your help.

my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to

would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new

RLC Increases New Jersey TV Ad Buy 
As Franks-Corzine Race Tightens 
Budget-Busting, Anti-Taxpayer Corzine Issues 
Beginning To Impact Senate Race

?Washington, DC -- The Republican Leadership Council (RLC) announced that it 
will increase its existing New Jersey TV ad buy by an additional $250,000, 
beginning immediately, and will step up efforts to point out the fiscal 
profligacy associated with Democrat Jon Corzine's economic platform. 

?""We're clearly making headway in our effort to educate New Jersey taxpayers 
about the real cost of Corzine's ideas for big government, and we're going to 
turn up the volume of our TV buy in New Jersey,"" said Mark Miller, Executive 
Director of the RLC.? ""The bottom line is that Jon Corzine's irresponsible 
'free lunch' big spending schemes will ruin our economic prosperity, and send 
the nation back into deficit spending."" 

?The RLC ad, which will be extended in both the Philadelphia and New York 
markets, charges that Corzine's spending programs would cost the average 
taxpayer $5,000 per year, and quotes a newspaper editorial saying that, 
""Corzine's... schemes would come at a tremendous cost to taxpayers."" 

?Meanwhile, a new Quinnipiac College survey of 909 likely New Jersey voters 
released today shows GOP candidate Bob Franks within five points, 46%-41%, 
even after being outspent by Corzine by record margins. 

?Miller noted that the new survey shows Corzine with an unimpressive 30% - 
26% Favorable/ Unfavorable rating overall, and evenly split among 
independents at 26%. 

?""Because Corzine's message is based almost entirely on giving away taxpayers 
dollars for government program after government program, taxpayers are 
looking more skeptically at his proposals,"" said Miller.? ""New Jersey 
taxpayers don't believe Corzine should spend their money as recklessly as he 
spends his own money.""

Robert Amaral <robert@kovair.com>,"Kovair Software, Inc. Strategic Customer/ Relationship Manageme nt
 Portal","Wed, 25 Oct 2000 08:25:00 -0700 (PDT)","Kenneth,

Key Customers, Partners, and Suppliers are your company's most valuable
strategic assets
as they account either for a majority of the revenues (80/20 rule) or carry
significant
investor mindshare.  The problem today is that these crucial relationships
are complex to manage, involving multiple people, systems, information, and
processes that cross company boundaries.  As a result, studies show that
sales teams are spending upto half their time managing day-to-day account
coordination - taking valuable time away from selling.

The question is - How can you successfully foster strategic relationships
while lowering account management costs?

Our CEO faced this problem when managing relationships like these for a
leading high-tech company.  She realized, in frustration, that there was no
infrastructure to manage strategic relationships consistently and
proactively.  There were front-office automation and CRM applications that
improved forecasting, sales support and other internal processes, and there
were personalization applications that pushed information to customers, but
there was no application that provided a comprehensive customer-driven view
of strategic relationships.

So, we developed the Kovair VIPCenter -- a relationship-centered application
that crosses company boundaries and consolidates all the touchpoints in a
strategic relationship (people, applications, information, and processes).

Each VIPCenter is a bi-directional, relationship-specific Web portal that
fosters long-term collaboration and deeper intimacy with each of your
strategic partners, suppliers, and customers throughout the relationship
cycle.

VIPCenter has a unique extensible application architecture. Out-of-the-box,
VIPCenter has
all the core applications needed to manage strategic relationships so you
can be up and
running quickly.  And, it is built on Kovair's patented SRM platform,
providing seamless interoperability with CRM and ERP applications,
enterprise-class scalability, and extensibility.

Simply put, Kovair's VIPCenter allows you to build more intimate long-term
relationships with these key customers, suppliers and partners, while
lowering account management costs.

I have attached a Product Data Sheet, Technical Architecture Overview, and a
White Paper from the Aberdeen Group illustrating the importance of Strategic
Relationship Management.

I know it can sometimes be difficult to understand a solution from a simple
email. For a demonstration, or for more information on how we can help you
maximize the value of your strategic relationships, please contact me at
your earliest convenience. I can be reached at 408-546-2014.

Lisa Hobbs,Duchess of Northumbria's request,"Thu, 26 Oct 2000 09:20:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite ""no"".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given
recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May
to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when
it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy
markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a ""quid pro quo"" from us.

"""Walker, Bruce J."" <Walker@missouri.edu>",P. Walker professorship and keynote request,"Mon, 28 Aug 2000 09:17:00 -0700 (PDT)","Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the
professorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to
attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.

The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient
way of reaching you, is two-fold:

     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney
C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the
professorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some
other area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in
the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.
Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into
Harold Hook to seek his input.

A few points of elaboration:
     * ""Distinguished"" is a standard adjective in the titles of such
positions.
     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the
college to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my
approval.
     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October
13.

This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,
(2) allows me to avoid any ""turf battles"" (either within the college or with
Economics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the
college.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.

     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society
banquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief
talk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of
business.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive
event.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now
live in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have
chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.
Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed
(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.
I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the
morning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable
for the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in
choosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you
will serve as the keynote speaker.

If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the
plans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney
Walker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if
you have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is
573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.

Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not
Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been
experiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that
he intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.
Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll
see him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his
wife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I
will host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of
course, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's
my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)

Ken, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of ""R&R""
during your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.","[('I', 11), ('October', 9), ('would', 7)]"

bill.miller@uschamber.com,Election Update!,"Sat, 28 Oct 2000 10:23:00 -0700 (PDT)","Dear Chamber Members,

The time for you to make a difference is now!

We have only 10 days until we elect a new president and a new
Congress, and the U.S. Chamber needs your help.  The U.S.
Chamber of Commerce represents you - America's business
community - and now is when we can make a difference.

Helping to elect pro-business candidates is not something we
should take for granted. That's why the U.S. Chamber has been
working hard over the past few months to help pro-business
candidates get elected. We've endorsed these candidates,
campaigned on their behalf, donated to their campaigns, and,
most importantly, lent them the awesome reputation of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.

We now need your help to make sure we are successful on
November 7th.  Please take a moment now and visit the
Elections 2000 page on our web site.  This page can be
found by going to http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/.

Once there, click on Pro-Business Candidates and you will find a
list of the candidates we are actively campaigning for and
support along with information about their race.  After you select
a particular candidate, we have also made it possible for you to
contribute directly to selected campaigns by selecting Contribute
On-line Now!

I would also ask that you take a moment to read a recent op-ed by
U.S. Chamber CEO Tom Donohue.  This op-ed titled - Business
As the Target - highlights the attacks the business community is
under from anti-business candidates.  I also feel it underscores the
importance of helping to elect and voting for pro-business
candidates!

To read Mr. Donohue's op-ed, please click here -
http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/_Business+as+the+Target.htm

Or, to help elect pro-business candidates, please:

1. Visit http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/
2. Click on Pro-Business Candidates
3. Select the candidate you would like to support!
4. Make a contribution of $150, $100, $75, or $50 directly to their campaign!

Please feel free to email me if you have any questions or if I can be of
assistance to you.  And, thank you for helping us to elect candidates
who support business!

Sincerely,

Bill Miller
Political Director


P.S.  Please visit http://www.uschamber.com/Elections/, select a
pro-business candidate, and make a contribution directly to their
campaign.  Remember there are only 10 days left until the
election, so they need support from the business community now.

the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking
garage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines
being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully
agreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the
development front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a
buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any
issues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing
development management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have
talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this
should ""be the Authority's idea."".  One issue is how much of our fee would
apply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much
would apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you
to know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.
If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please
give me a call at 713-966-2606.

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite ""no"".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin

provide scholarships for Enron dependants to attend the University of Houston 
and fund operating expenses.  Mr. Lay has graciously agreed to be our 
honorary chair for this event which will most certainly guarantee success.  I 
would like to ask that Enron participate in this event from a sponsorship 
capacity. Many Enron employees, University of Houston faculty, students and 
alumni will be participating and I believe that this will be a chance to 
promote the Enron name in all of those areas.  Considering that we are 
pushing the area of recruiting with this university, this will be an 
excellent way to enhance said efforts.  We will be marketing the sponsors 
through advertising, tournament recognition and special mention at the post 
tournament reception and dinner.  The levels are as follows:

Amount Level   What is received 
$5,000.00  Title sponsor  Advertising and recognition throughout the entire 
event.  2 teams of four to play the tournament.  Golf shirts, lunch and      
dinner  for sponsor participants.  Invitation to present scholarships at the

$2,500.00 Gold sponsor  Advertising and recognition throughout the entire 
event.  1 team of four to play the tournament.  Golf shirts, lunch and

$2,500.00 Silver sponsor  Advertising and recognition throughout the entire 
event.  2 people to play the tournament.  Golf shirts, lunch and dinner

$100  Hole sponsor  Advertising at 1 hole of the tournament.

I believe that Enron would benefit from participating in this event.  The 
scholarships benefits Enron employees, there are 650 Enron employees that are 
graduates of the University of Houston who will take great pride in knowing 
that Enron supports their university, the recruiting program will benefit 
because deans, faculty, professional groups, students and alumni will be 
involved which should enhance relations that would beneficial to our efforts

Fujitsu is the second largest IT company in the world and Japan's largest

Fujitsu is a large consumer of electricity and broadband. I would like to get 
the executives of the two companies talking.
      I think there are major opportunities for Enron to sell ""stuff"" to 
Fujitsu, for Fujitsu to sell ""stuff"" to Enron, and to jointly

Hello dear siblings... yes, believe it or not, I  am sending one of my rare 
e-mails.?
?
I will be in charge of distributing Rocket  tickets this season for mom and 
Ken?since I successfully accomplished  baseball ticket distribution without 
having a nervous breakdown.? You all  were actually wonderful and made it 
very easy due to the rules that were set  up by the folks prior to my 
receiving that responsibility.? Organization  comes natural to me so I am 
happy to do it again so that mom has one less  thing on her plate.
?
Rules have not yet been sent out by mom and  Ken,?but I do want to get a jump 
start on the season distribution since  it is upon us already.? With 
baseball, all ticket were requested prior to  the 1st of each month, so that 
I was able to commit game tickets to family and  then to Mom and Ken's 
significant other people for that  given?month.? Tickets were requested and 
guaranteed one  month?at a time?not further out?than that.? There was also  
some sort of first come first serve rule?which I don't fully remember but  it 
also never became a problem.??All of these rules made it  work?so I suggest 
sticking to them  again?regarding?basketball.??(Mom and Ken?may null  and 
void all of this with new rules but these are my suggestions until they do  
so.)
?
There are 4 tickets grouped together on row 1 and  an additional 4 tickets 
grouped together on row 2.? So, this year we have  the pleasure of an 
additional 4 tickets at each game which should make the  rubics cube of 
ticket distribution a bit easier.
?
November games include:
?
Thursday??? ???  Nov.2?????? ?? 7:30  pm??? Milwaukee
Tuesday??? ???  ?Nov.7???????? 7:30  pm??? Los Angeles
Thursday??? ???  Nov.9?????? ?? 7:30  pm??? Vancover

Tuesday??????  ? Nov. 28???????7:30  pm??? Sacramento
?
Please let me know ASAP what your requests are  for the month of November and 
I will do my best to try and make everyone  happy.? This needs to be resolved 
by friday of this week  Nov.3rd so that I am able to distribute to family and 
then start  making calls down the list of mom and Ken's significant other 
people so that  all tickets are used.? If you have not contacted me by friday 
with your  requests, I will distribute tickets so no whining is allowed if 
you don't get  what you later realize you want.? Remember FRIDAY IS THE 
DEADLINE FOR THE  MONTH OF NOVEMBER.
?
Regarding December, get your requests in now  which will be final and tickets 
will be distributed to everyone by  friday the?1st of December.
No tickets will go unused.

ENRON ANOUNCES EMPLOYEE PROGRAM
On October 5, Enron announced ""it will give employees of its wholly owned
subsidiaries a high-speed computer and Internet connection, including
broadband connectivity, for use at home, beginning in 2001.   .......Through
a company-wide computer drive, employees will be able to donate their
existing home computers to Technology For All (www.techforall.org) , a
national program working to bridge the digital divide.""   Technology For All
thanks Ken Lay for his leadership in this decision that also helps TFA serve
America's underserved and disadvantaged.
For more information, the full press release is located at
http://www4.enron.com/corp/pr/releases/2000/ene/87-PC-Enron.html .


$45 MILLION SMARTFORCE DONATION TO BE ANNOUNCED NOVEMBER 15
On November 15 TFA and SmartForce
(http://www.smartforce.com/corp/marketing/default.htm ) will post a joint
press release announcing the donation of 450,000 scholarships for SmartForce
eLearning courses to be delivered through the TFA secure website to end
users seeking training with TFA collaborative program partners across the
US.  The 600 online courses available through the program are in English and
Spanish and include everything from computer basics to various levels of
technical certification. This generous gift to TFA will be utilized over a
three year period and has a retail value of approximately $45 million. A key
component of the gift will be the inclusion of a ""SmartJobs"" section on the
web site that will list companies doing business with SmartForce that have
pledged to interview job applicants who successfully complete training
through a TFA/SmartForce course. Scott Yeager will call Greg Priest, CEO of
Smarforce, on behalf of TFA and thank him for this generous gift toward the
Technology For All initiative.

AMERICA CONNECTS CONSORTIUM
TFA is working with the America Connects Consortium (ACC) to help support
Community Technology Centers across the US. The ACC received recently
received a $2 million Department of Education  grant to support CTC efforts.
The benefits to TFA include program support for existing TFA programs and
the ability to share best practices across the US. The consortium will
assist TFA in its city by city model by helping encourage exisiting
organizations to work together. In addition to sharing TFA online content
TFA will also host online curriculum resources created by the consortium on
the private side of our web site.  The work of the Consortium will begin
with an organizational meeting in Boston, November 15-16.  For more
information read the full release posted on the TFA web site at.
http://www.techforall.org/showdoc.cfm?id=35&ret=new

BLUECURRENT RELATIONSHIP FINALIZED
TFA recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Bluecurrent.  Through
the relationship Bluecurrent will assist TFA with the management and
donation of corporate technology assets across the US.  Through the creative
use of donated assets as ""currency"" the Bluecurrent relationship will save
TFA $13.5 million in projected cash expenses over the next five years to
process and redeploy corporate technology assets donated to TFA.  In
addition, we believe this relationship will dramatically increase the
computers available to TFA and its program partners.  For more information
about Bluecurrent go to http://www.bluecurrent.com .

LINCT COALITION ""LEARN AND EARN"" PROGRAM TO EMPOWER
One of the beneficiaries of the Bluecurrent relationship will be the ability
of TFA to more quickly rollout the TFA/LINCT coalition ""Learn and Earn""
Program. This program will allow disadvantaged persons who participate in
the program to learn how to use a computer and then mentor another person
using the same curriculum. By completing both parts of this cross-age peer
tutoring program, participants will then ""earn"" a computer to take home,
thus creating new opportunities for education and economic empowerment.
More information about the LINCT coalition ""learn and earn"" program can be
found at http://www.linct.org/

DIGITAL DIVIDENDS CONFERENCE, SEATTLE
Two weeks ago I attended the Digital Dividends Conference in Seattle.  The
focus of the Conference was ""creating digital dividends"" and exploreing
innovative approaches to closing the global digital divide.  The conference
was hosted by the World Resources Institute, chaired by William D.
Ruckelshaus, and reviewed business modesl and market development strategies
to close the digital divide.  I made several important connections at the
conference including key personnel with Hewlett Packard.  Carly Fiorina,
HP's CEO, announced a huge global initiative by Hewlett Packard to address
the digital divide in 1000 villages across the world.

ASIA FOUNDATION RELATIONSHIP BEING DEVELOPED
Through the introduction of Enron lobbyist David Merrill, former ambassador
to Bangladesh during the Bush adminstration, TFA met last week with the
President and several staff members of the Asia Foundation. The Asia
Foundation supports economic development and other efforts in Asia and is
funded by private contributions and the US State Department. The Asia
Foundation indicated an interest in working together with TFA in the future
as Enron expands its backbone to Japan and other Asian countries.

LAY AND TROTTER ASSIST IN FUNDRAISING EFFORTS
TFA and its local affiliate Technology For All-Houston are working together
to follow through on grant requests of $5 million over a three year period
from Houston area foundations.  We have had initially o\positive responses
from Houston Endowment and the Brown Foundation as well as several smaller
foundations including the Hamman Foundation and the Sterling Turner
Foundation. We are also preparing requests to Houston area corporations and
friends of TFA that will go out in the next few weeks.  A bridge loan from
the Redstone bank has been secured to get us through the next couple of
months. TFA anticipates a need for $4.5 million in cash over the next twelve
months to help us build capacity and long term sustainability.  With the
creative business relationships being created we expect to be able to insure
sustainability of the organization after the initial capacity is secured.
However, until that time, TFA will be dependent upon the cash and in-kind
contributions of foundations, corporations, its board members and friends.

PROGRESS CONTINUES ON IVERCITY DEAL
The IverCity ""deal"" is an example of an innovative and creative solution for
long-term sustainability.  Through the co-branding of the TFA/IverCity web
site, we hope to drive web users to IverCity content and thus create the
potential for a IverCity liquidity event that will benefit TFA's long term
capital needs.  Jack Clark has done a superb job creating the draft of the
legal document outlining the deal.  We thank Jack Trotter for his suggestion
to create a convertible royalty rather than just equity by itself.  The
benefit to TFA is the ability for TFA to be compensated by the number of
users we direct to the IverCity content which will be useful to TFA
constituents.

ROSEMARIE FOSTER TO JOIN TFA AS ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT
Effective, November 20, Rosemarie Foster will be joining the TFA staff
fulltime as administrative assistant.  She will begin working some partime
hours this week. Thanks to Jack Trotter and Jack Clark for providing office
space for Rosemarie.  Additional TFA staff are being c\interviewed to assist
with fund-raising, program development, web site development and network
infrastructure support.

DISCUSSIONS WITH INTERNET POLICY INSTITUTE
Justin Cornett represented TFA recently at a ""town hall"" meeting of the
Internet Policy Institute (IPI) in Austin.  The IPI will be working with TFA
in our Washington DC rollout. We will be meeting with them again next week
in DC. We thank Ken Lay for his initial introductions to the board members
and staff of the IPI.

NEW YORK, LOS ANGELES, WASHINGTON DC, SAN DIEGO, ATLANTA
Through introductions from TFA board members and others we are beginning to
develop key contacts in each of the cities noted above. Board assistance
will be required as we also seek to develop co-branding corporate
relationships.  As per the wishes of the board, we are focused on New York,
Washington DC, and Los Angeles first.  We will keep you posted and request
your assistance as appropriate.

ROAD-SHOW.COM DONATES WEBCAST PRODUCTION

Dan Yergin <dyergin@CERA.com>,Governors Conference,"Tue, 15 Aug 2000 05:22:00 -0700 (PDT)","Dear Ken, 

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, 
has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on 
natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in 
contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current 
chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the 
auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of 
other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking 
off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility 
platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have 
you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very 
large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in 
further on what they would like to accomplish.

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best,

This is a brief note to thank you for taking the time to serve as a

personal development is deeply appreciated.  You are a fine role model and
someone who continues to inspire me to strive further.

I have taken a job as President and CEO of ChainDrugStore.net, a web based

Indiana - John Hostettler

U.S. Representative John Hostettler faces a tough challenge from
Paul Perry, an orthopedic surgeon who has used his medical
connections to raise substantial amounts of money.  However,
Rep. Hostettler cannot be underestimated and has earned an 83%
rating with the U.S. Chamber in 1999.  Business should stand by
his side in this election that will likely be won by a narrow margin.

Kentucky - Ernie Fletcher

Rep. Ernie Fletcher, who earned a 96% positive voting record
with the Chamber, is in a tough race and has come under heavy
criticism from anti-business forces for his votes supporting the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce's positions.   His loss would be a
symbolic victory for anti-business interests, which would like to
claim that his support of pro-business positions caused his
defeat.

Mr. Rogers is the cofounder of a family building business, an
ex-Army officer, and a former FBI special agent. He has a strong
understanding of the need to create and maintain a pro-business
environment.  Recent polls have him running slightly ahead of his
opponent, but the presidential campaigns make Michigan extremely

Arkansas - Jay Dickey

U.S. Rep. Jay Dickey has earned an admirable 94% approval
rating from the U.S. Chamber. That's not surprising, since Dickey
is himself a small businessman, owning a number of food
franchises in Arkansas.  Rep. Dickey's opponent, State Senator
Michael Ross voted to raise the income tax rate on corporations.

Recent polling shows Rep. Jim Rogan with a slight lead over his
opponent.  However, this race is expected to be extremely close

supporting free enterprise, sponsoring legislation supporting
small businesses, voting for tax reforms and free trade and
advocating other key pro-business positions.  To help his

California's 36th District is a battleground this year with U.S.

is clear: it's Kuykendall, who has voted with the U.S. Chamber

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these ""black-outs"" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of ""inside

We'd like to sincerely thank you for heading our way and helping us kick off 
the official opening of Enron's businesses in Japan.  The feedback that we 
have received has been very positive and the website has been a big hit.  
Preliminary figures for the Enron Japan website look promising.  We've had 
over 12,000 page hits over the last three days with an average of >300 unique 
visitors per day.  We have also received quite a few requests for the 10% 
discount product.  The utilities are scrambling to try and understand what 
the product is and why we are doing this.

I also wanted to pass along that while the TEPCO meeting was probably in line 
with what we expected, our interpreter made it clear to me that the TEPCO 
interpreter was very poor and did not accurately convey the meaning and tone 
from the Chairman.  In fact, the TEPCO Chairman was more positive and would 
sincerely like to find ways to cooperate.  We'll try, but I would remain 
somewhat skeptical.

Thanks again.

Economist

Washington, D.C. August 29, 2000 -- Scott Hodge has been named executive
director of the Tax Foundation. Most recently he has worked as director of
tax and budget policy at Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation and is
recognized as one of Washington's leading experts on the federal budget. He
has been widely published on fiscal policy, notably in the pages of The Wall
Street Journal, The Washington Post, USA Today, and The Washington Times.
His work as Senior Budget Analyst at the Heritage Foundation included the
editing of three books on the federal budget. Mr. Hodge has been a
commentator on nightly news shows such as NBC Nightly News and CBS Nightly
News, and has been seen regularly on CNN, Fox Network, and C-SPAN.
At the same time, Patrick Fleenor has been named the Foundation's chief
economist. On staff at the Tax Foundation since 1993, Fleenor has improved
the Foundation's core research projects, such as Tax Freedom Day and The
Federal Tax Burden by State, and he has published extensive economic
analyses of excise and estate taxes. Fleenor has a reputation among the
media as a reliable source for tax data on myriad subjects.
Hodge and Fleenor replace J.D. Foster who held both titles from 1993 to June
of this year, when he announced his departure for the staff of Rep. Phil
Crane (R-IL). Foster will be legislative director and economic counsel to
Rep. Crane, who is currently the second-ranking Republican on the House Ways
and Means Committee, and chairman of its subcommittee on trade.

News from Los Angeles in the Los Angeles Times
Riordan to Join L.A. Unified After He Leaves City Hall
 <<...>> Mayor: In an address to Valley leaders, he strongly denounces
secession, then makes surprising disclosure about plan to take executive
post with district.
By JIM NEWTON, Times Staff Writer


In his final annual address on the state of the San Fernando Valley, Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday delivered his most forceful call
ever for that area to remain part of the larger city, then surprised the
audience by announcing that he will go to work for the Los Angeles Unified
School District when he finishes his term in office.
Speaking to a group of Valley business leaders, Riordan denounced secession
on political, moral and practical grounds, warning that it would force a tax
hike, leave the Valley with uncertain leadership and abandon the city's
poor.
""I love the Valley,"" Riordan said. ""I feel that you're part of the family,
and I don't want you to desert the family. . . . The rest of the city needs
you. You can't abandon the poor. It just isn't right.""
Riordan's pointed rejection of secession represents a significant escalation
in his efforts to head off that politically charged prospect--a topic so
heated that in a mayoral debate following Riordan's speech, not one of the
six candidates angling for election in April so much as mentioned the word.
Riordan, by contrast, tackled the issue head-on and in far more
confrontational terms than he ever has before.
""Secession,"" Riordan said bluntly, ""is a lousy idea.""
As significant as that pronouncement was, however, the mayor almost
overshadowed it with an offhand personal remark in response to a question
after his speech. Asked to elaborate on his thoughts about breaking up the
school district, Riordan let slip that he intends to go to work for L.A.
Unified after he finishes his second term as mayor, which ends next summer.
The mayor, who helped elect four of the school board's seven members, said
he has been in discussions with Supt. Roy Romer and has agreed to accept an
""executive position"" with the district next year. Riordan did not elaborate,
but in an interview later, he said he and the superintendent had agreed that
Riordan would run the district's classroom computer program.
The former Colorado governor, who now runs the city's schools, was not
immediately available for comment.
At the district, Riordan said, he will be in charge of working with schools
to make effective use of computers in the classroom. Riordan, who has
donated thousands of computers to schools in various parts of the country,
said the job fit his talents. ""I think this is something I'm good at,"" he
said. ""I know the experts in the field.""
Riordan's post-mayoral plans have for months been the object of much
speculation. Most observers predicted he would do something in the field of
education, because no topic animates Riordan as much as children and
schools.
But Riordan is a multimillionaire, and he will be over 70 when he finishes
his second term as mayor. He passed up the chance to run for governor in
1998, and some friends had predicted he would slow down when he wrapped up
his mayoral administration.
The idea of a quiet retirement, however, seems to have little appeal for
Riordan, an energetic and restless man. Asked how long he intended to take
off between finishing his work as mayor and starting his new job at the
school district, Riordan responded: ""three or four hours.""
Riordan has held office for nearly eight years, and for that entire time has
enjoyed the strong support of the San Fernando Valley. It was the Valley
that helped put him in office in 1993, and polls since have shown that
though he is popular citywide, he enjoys his greatest approval ratings north
of the Hollywood Hills.
As the race to succeed him gathers steam, some of the candidates clearly
covet Riordan's base in the Valley.
On Friday, City Councilman Joel Wachs often invoked the mayor's name during
a low-energy debate among the six leading mayoral candidates. Among other
things, Wachs praised Riordan's economic development initiatives and his
handling of the recently completed negotiations between the city and federal
government over the future of the Los Angeles Police Department.
So effusive was Wachs in his praise of Riordan that eventually businessman
Steve Soboroff complained. As Soboroff pointed out to the audience, Riordan
has endorsed his candidacy, not Wachs'. Soboroff suggested that his rival
withdraw from the race and back him instead.
Wachs laughed, but did not respond.
The debate--really more of a panel discussion in which the candidates rarely
addressed one another, while sitting cheek-by-jowl in straight-backed
chairs--also was notable as the first joint appearance of the candidates to
include state Controller Kathleen Connell, the latest contender to join the
race.
Connell used her debut debate performance to stress her determination to
bring tough fiscal management to the problems of Los Angeles. She addressed
issues such as police corruption, transportation and the city's business
climate in terms of their economic impact, arguing that her experience in
the private sector and as controller made her the right person to handle
that task.
In other debate highlights, City Atty. James Hahn and Assemblyman Antonio
Villaraigosa enthusiastically welcomed the signing of the consent decree
with the federal government on police reform.
Connell, Wachs and U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra also applauded the deal, though
in less glowing terms.
Soboroff was the only candidate to oppose it, calling it an abdication of
local responsibility.

Materials have been sent to the contacts you made for TFA in LA. Beyond that
I have been focused recently on finalizing the TFA relationships with
Smartforce and IverCity.Com.  We will announce the Smartforce donation (450K
eLearning scholarships over three years) at a meeting in Boston on November
15.  This is a huge gift ($30-$45 million in retail value).  I have been in
contact (phone and face to face visits) with several nonprofit groups in LA
involved in local initiatives there.  Some of these groups are working
together and some are not.  15,000 ($1.5 million in value) of the Smartforce
eLearning courses are reserved for LA and could be utilized by local groups
there if they can work together. It is my hope that TFA can help encourage
that. One of the issues, of course, is identifying other potential
co-branding corporations/foundations that can help bring the necessary
dollars to the table. In-kind donations have been relatively easy to
accumulate. Finding the necessary cash is more difficult. I do agree with
you that Mayor Riordan's future plans could be good for TFA.  Perhaps we can
talk by phone in the next day or two to follow through on some of our
previous discussions.  I will be in Washington DC later in the week to meet
with the Internet Policy Institute, the Pew Foundation and others.


I have also been following through on some contacts in DC and New York City.
Again, we will need co-branding relationships with $'s and in-kind resources
to make this work.

We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
after 7pm for those in line.
Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
people available to transport people to the polls.
Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
Republicans will have representatives at most of the
polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
from me and everyone else)!
Take care and VOTE!

Gene Humphrey,Meeting with Stedman Graham,"Mon, 6 Nov 2000 02:20:00 -0800 (PST)","Ken,  thanks for agreeing to meet with Stedman Graham at two this afternoon.  
The following should give you some talking points and background:

 Stedman Graham is most noted for being the companion to Oprah Winfrey, 
however he is CEO of two firms which are in the marketing and educational 
consulting business.

 Enron has been discussing using Graham's consulting services for our 
Associate program to focus on leadership training and develop.

 We are considering him as a potential advisory board member for Enron 
Investment Partners.  This will be our first meeting with him so we are not 
yet ready to propose a board seat yet.

 We also hope that any relationship we develop with him could lead to a 
connection with Oprah Winfrey for the purpose of further expanding the 
publicity for EIP and Enron and also to  access additional investment dollars.

 Prior to your meeting we will have introduced him to EIP and Enron so he 
should be well briefed on the company.  I think it would be good if you could 
focus on the activities of EIP and the reason why Enron would be supportive 
of this type of business since that is always a question that comes up.  I 
understand that Linda will join us during the meeting and want to talk about 
the Holocaust Museum and Oprah's potential involvement with it.

 Also with us will be Danny Lawson whom you have met.  Danny was the mayor's  
chief fund raiser for the last two elections and is very active locally.  
Last Friday Danny facilitated a meeting between EES and Jew Don Boney for the 
purpose of moving along the potential energy services contract between EES 
and the city of Houston.  He has been a strong supporter of ours for quite 
some time and is also a candidate for the advisory board.  Danny currently 
sets on the Cynet board.

 Please let me know if there is any other information that would be useful

They told us in orientation that it was okay to send you an e-mail, so I hope 
I am not rocking the boat here! I just wanted to say that I am proud to be 
working for Enron and Net Works!

From a book review on Amazon.com...


""According to Gary Hamel, the professor-turned-strategy-guru author of 
Leading the Revolution, complacent establishment giants and one-strategy 
start-ups are on the same side of the fence--the wrong side. He blows apart 
the popular myth that innovation lies solely in the hands of dot.com dynamos 
like AOL and Amazon by scrutinizing the examples of such ""gray-haired 
revolutionaries"" as Enron and Charles Schwab, companies that have managed to 
reinvent both themselves and their entire industries, time and again.""

Brian Redmond,Your Question on HMS,"Mon, 6 Nov 2000 04:38:00 -0800 (PST)","Dr. Lay:

As you know, Enron owns a minority interest in Hanover Compressor Corp.   On 
several ocassions, Mel Klein of GKH has discussed the possibility that Enron 
purchase GKH's interest in Hanover.  This is an option that ENA has not 
recommended to date, as I understand that at current prices we are more of a 
seller than a buyer.  Jeff Donahue is responsible for this investment and can 
answer any specific questions.

In respect to HMS,  Enron and Hanover established Hanover Measurement 
Services (HMS) as a joint venture to provide pipeline measurement services.  
HMS is structured as an (Enron:Hanover)  49:51 equity and 50:50 control 
partnership.  Enron and Hanover each have 2 representatives on the Board.

Enron (through Houston Pipe Line)  invested $2.5MM of initial capital in HMS 
and entered into a measurement service contract with HMS.  HMS has also 
entered into a service contract with Kinder Morgan and is seeking to enter 
into similar contracts with other pipelines.  

Potential HMS Topics of Discussion

1. Enron is in the processing of selling HPL - the service contract between 
HPL and HMS will be assigned to the  purchaser of HPL.  

2. Enron will retain its interest in HMS, but we are open to both Enron and 
Hanover selling a portion of our equity to a new pipeline/producer customer.

"""Dick O'Neill"" <rpon@bellatlantic.net>",Secretary of Defense-sponsored Highlands Forum,"Mon, 6 Nov 2000 08:49:00 -0800 (PST)","Dear Mr. Lay:

On behalf of Assistant Secretary of Defense (C3I) and DoD CIO Arthur Money,
I would like to invite you to participate in the Secretary of Defense's
Highlands Forum. The Highlands Forum is a cross-disciplinary group of
eminent scholars, researchers, CEO's/CIO's/CTO's from industry, and leaders
from the media, the arts and the professions, who have met over the past six
years to examine areas of emerging interest to all of us.  The idea is to
gain a better understanding of the new environment we will all be living and
working in, and to examine the fundamental changes that will impact that
environment.  The Forum includes seniors from the White House, Defense, and
other agencies of government (we limit government participation to about
25%).  Our meetings over the past six years have covered such diverse topics
as ""The Mind, the Brain, and Computing""; ""The Convergence of Information
Technology and Biotechnology""; and ""Innovation in Public Sector
Organizations"".  Our meeting in May explored MEMS, nanotechnology, and
molecular computing; among our participants were: Sun Microsystems founder
Bill Joy, Phil Kuekes of HP, Nobel laureate Rick Smalley. Our last meeting
in September focused on the future of software, and participants included
Inktomi founder Eric Brewer, SUN CTO Greg Papadopoulos, Packet Design CEO
Judy Estrin (board member of FedEx and Cisco), and Esther Dyson.

The Forum is an idea engine--there are no reports and no consensus
recommendations. Meeting size is usually kept to around 30 people to remain
small and informal, encouraging maximum discussion of ideas presented by a
speaker or a panel; we call it strategic conversation.  While there is media
participation in our meetings, there is no press coverage of the
discussions.  Our distinguised media participants in this meeting (CEO, UPI;
Exec. Editor, International Herald Tribune) will take part representing
themselves and will  act as moderators.

Several of our participants strongly suggested that I contact you to tell
you about the Forum and this particular meeting. We are going to hold
Highlands Forum 16 in Washington, DC, on December 14-15 (half day on the
15th).  The topic will be built around the search for
information/transformation strategies for the Department of Defense (and
government in general). The Assistant Secretary would like to hold this
Highlands to think about the elements of an information strategy, and I have
suggested that we look at information and strategy from a business
perspective (transformation, productivity, competitive advantage).  We will
look at  4 or 5 useful business cases for context.  ENRON is a remarkable
example of transformation in a highly rigid, regulated industry, that has
created a new model and new markets.

The Defense Department is not only creating an operational strategy which
has information superiority (better, faster decision making) at its core;
the Department also has an enormous global business enterprise which can
benefit from many of the best practices and ideas from industry enabling it
to achieve greater efficiencies and be a better steward of public funds.
Clearly, not all the elements translate well from the business envrionment,
however, many do.  I am interested in business cases which ideally describe
an enterprise-level information or transformation strategy--those which see
an information strategy as the overarching strategy, or at least as a core
component of corporate/operational strategy--use of information technology,
information protection/assurance, CRM, and perhaps how to use information
and technology to transition or capture or create a new market. One
operational example that we will look at is Cemex, the Mexican cement
company that uses I.T. (GPS and communications) to ""swarm"" its trucks in the
ready cement business. Their COO will be joining us to describe how they
succeeded in dominating their market. In addition to Cemex, other companies
represented in our agenda include Cisco, eBay, Schwab, and Sourceree.

ENRON is of great interest to us.  What we learn from you may help the
Department of Defense a great deal as it works to build a new strategy. I
hope that you have time on your busy schedule to join us for as much of the
Highlands Forum as you can attend and speak with the group. I would be happy
to tell you more about the Forum.  In the meantime, please take a look at
the Secretary's Website for the Forum to get a better idea of what it is and
what is has accomplished: www.hlforum.com; username: cc27 (lowercase);
password: SVN8 (Uppercase). I am also attaching a short document which gives

Jeffrey Sherrick,"India ""CPIL"" Supreme Court Case","Wed, 30 Aug 2000 06:39:00 -0700 (PDT)","The Supreme Court hearing for the case in India regarding the alleged 
improper bidding and award of the Panna/Mukta block concluded today.  Our 
legal team's opinion is very optimistic based on the way the proceeding 
progressed and also on the actions of the chief judge during the concluding 
arguments of the case today in India. 

The panel of three judges will now take approximately 2 months to write their 
opinion and that should complete this case.  While I probably shouldn't  
speculate on the outcome, I will summarize my opinion of the important 
points:  1) there is little doubt that the Panna/Mukta award to 
Enron/Reliance/ONGC will stand, and  2) it is highly unlikely that the judges 
will request the PSC to be renegotiated, the contract was portrayed and 
generally accepted by the panel as a very fair deal for the GOI.  According 
to my general counsel, Stephen Wallace, the only concern our team has is that 
the judges were quite critical of the CBI (the government group that 
investigated Reliance for wrong doing in the bid process) during that portion 
of the testimony and there is a possibility that they could request an 
additional investigation.  Our team puts the likelihood of the judges 
ordering a new investigation at less than 50%.  There is downside to such a 
decision in that it creates uncertainty, but the focus would be on Reliance, 
not Enron. 

Enron was very prepared on the commercial and the legal front and our team, 
as expected, carried the load for this case even though we were not the 
primary defendants.  Enron presented the major rebuttal to the CPIL 
assertions because the others were not prepared and then later ""coached"" the 
others to help them prepare appropriately.   This was a much more intensive 
case than people were assuming it would be last year and we were very 
fortunate to be extremely well prepared and well represented.   

Based on the above information,  I do not think this issue ""CPIL lawsuit""  
should  impact any future decisions we make regarding the Panna/ Mukta/Tapti 
assets.  This outcome basically eliminates one of the two issues impeding the 
progress of  the  project I showed Joe, our proposal to sell 
Panna/Mukta/Tapti, that we call Project Janus.  We believe we have a unique 
opportunity to realize exceptional value for these assets through an 
arrangement with our partner.  The strategy we have mapped out should  allow 
us to close the transaction prior to year-end and it has very positive cash 
flow and neutral financial implications (minimal if any gain due to the 
step-up last year) for the company.   The only remaining hurdle is a tax 
issue that we are currently working.

Congressman Sessions <Congressman.Sessions@mail.house.gov>,Presidential Inauguration,"Tue, 7 Nov 2000 06:22:00 -0800 (PST)","We are already receiving several inquiries regarding the upcoming
Presidential Inauguration.  Enclosed is information pertaining to everything
from hotel accommodations and travel to the Texas State Society Black Tie
and Boots Inaugural Ball, which is the official Presidential Inaugural Ball
for the State of Texas.

Furthermore, I would like you to notice that several of the hotels in
Washington, DC are not taking reservations until November 8, 2000.  In order
to reserve a room for the Inauguration, you might want to begin calling
hotels at the open of business on that day.  You will find a compiled list
of many hotels on pages four through six in the attached information.
Please make a note that most hotels require a minimum length of stay of four
nights.  You will want to plan accordingly.

In addition, I do not recommend that you rent a vehicle during your stay.
Due to the large number of people in Washington at this time, driving will
be next to impossible.  It is in your best interest to utilize the Metro
system or to take a cab.

I hope you find the enclosed to be useful.  Please feel free to call my
office at 202.225.2231 or email Jenny Sheffield at
jenny.sheffield@mail.house.gov if there is anything else that I can do to be
of assistance.  I look forward to seeing you in January!

 1. Enron over the past decade has become the most vigorous change agent
 in its industry.  From a leadership perspective, how have you created a
 culture of change in an industry not known for change?

 2. Nortel Networks has clearly made an outstanding transformation into
 the New Economy, similar to Enron's evolution. In Nortel's case, John Roth
 bought Bay Networks and infused the Nortel culture with Bays - almost a
 reverse cultural transformation.  How did you create a New Economy culture
 where innovation, risk-taking and new ideas are embraced and rewarded?

 3. Are there some best practices you can share with other CEOs and
 Managing Directors regarding leading a change?

 4. At best, change is difficult. But being able to change before you
 have to has only been accomplished successfully by a few companies.  How
 did you lead a change effort when you were arguably still a very
 successful utility?

 5. Peter Drucker has said than in stable time you need good management
 but in disruptive times you need leadership.  How have you been able to
 attract and retain what Fortune magazine has called the best management
 team?

 6. The New Economy is really all about creating a culture of
 innovation, where employees see opportunity and not barriers. Enron has
 been masterful at this from gas, to electricity, pulp & paper, and now
 bandwidth. As the ""keeper of the culture"" how did you establish and
 maintain such a culture?

 7. As Enron moves away from Plant, Property and Equipment towards
 Intangible Assets, what has changed for you as a leader in the age of
 intangibles?

 8. Can you list the four or five ""must have"" competencies for the 21st
 Century CEO? What experiences are necessary?

 9. Lets talk about going global. You have made very impressive in-roads
 in India where no other utility has been able to. How did you lead this
 effort? Are there any best practices you can share with your fellow CEO's
 who are thinking about India?

 10. Lets now move to Europe. Enron is the largest gas and power trader
 in Europe. Can you discuss your move into Europe? Again are there some
 best practices for CEOs in the USA moving into Europe?","[('change', 7), ('culture', 6), ('Enron', 5)]"

The suggested amount for you/Enron is $200,000--12.5% of the total.  Enron 
gave $50,000 for the 2000 effort, which was about 8% of the total they ended 
up raising ($617,000).   it is your call on what is reasonable, and keep in 
mind there might be another round later on.

We have been working on a list of potential donors with ""A"" being the 
impacted such as refiners and petrochemical companies and ""B"" being 
beneficiaries such as contractors.  Ned Holmes office suggested that you pick 
the names of the potential donors for the Enron visit and he will just take

Ken: Please note that Mr. Lars Uno Thulin has asked to meet with Bob Fisher 
of Hills and Company and I on Friday, December 1 while we are in Oslo to 
promote our campaign to get energy services support in the WTO. This meeting 
and others in Brussels and Dusseldorf earlier that week had been requested by 
the USTR as part of the grass roots outreach program. Considerable support 
for energy services has been building according to USTR although our own 
people indicated to Bob Fisher and me several days ago that Enron may not 
want to provide funding for the Energy Services Coaltion beyond December. 
Further, with my pending retirement in March, there is a question as to who 
from industry will lead the coaltion. Bob Fisher gave Rick a paper on 
developments and funding for the future although I submitted in my 2001 
budget proposal fully funding the effort.

Do you have any advice regarding a possible meeting with Mr. Thulin?

points:
* I understand that you will be coming in on Wednesday afternoon. From
the Airport there is an express train that takes you to the down town area
in less than 20 minutes, considerably quicker than by car. I would be happy
to meet you at the Grand Hotel in the evening for an informal talk, unless
you have other plans. I would also be happy to accompany you  throughout the
programme.
* The people that you will meet in the MFA will basically be those
dealing with the WTO-negotiations, and who are all familiar with the
proposals on energy services. So we could talk on how to deal with the issue
in the ongoing and coming negotiations.
* You will meet key personalities in the Ministry for oil and energy
* Director General Arne Walther is host for a luncheon - he is
currently holding the positions as Chairman of the Board of the
International Energy Agency (IEA)
* You are invited as Key Note Speakers at a workshop on energy
services in the house of The Federation of Norwegian Business and Industry,
which will invite a selected group of leading personalities throughout the
energy business sector in Norway.
* I understand that you will host a dinner in the evening; I would be
happy to advise you on participants, as appropriate; I presume that you ,
i.a., will invite representatives from your company and the US Embassy
* I talked to the CEO of STATKRAFT, Mr. Lars Uno Thulin, who is a good
friend of mine, and who also is well acquainted with the President of Enron,
Mr. Ken Lay. He would appreciate an opportunity for a private conversation,
and suggests a breakfast Friday morning as an option. Please let me know if
this is possible.

I wish you and Bob Fisher very welcome to Oslo!

Yours sincerely

Calif Regulators,Grid Oper In Turf War Over Generation By JASON LEOPOLD Of
DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES-California's electricity regulators and
power-grid operator are locked in a turf war over who has the authority to
order new power plant construction next summer to ensure the state has
enough juice on hand when demand soars.
The California Public Utilities Commission says it can bring emergency
power on line at a fraction of the cost that the Independent System
Operator is expected to pay independent power producers for the same
service.
Under it's plan, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Edison
International's (EIX) Southern California Edison unit and Sempra Energy's
(SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. were ordered to submit documents by the
end of November stating whether they can build and operate ""peaking"" plants
by June 1.
The utilities weren't immediately available to comment.
On the other hand, the ISO - which is on the verge of signing contracts for
440 peaking units with between 20 and 91 megawatts of electricity - says
the commission's meddling could endanger any chance of additional resources
coming on line in time.
""Any further interference on the state level could destroy the plan
altogether,"" said an ISO source close to the issue. ""There is no guarantee
the utilities will be able to pull this off by next summer. And if the
whole project is scrapped, you can expect there will be blackouts.""
Interference by federal regulators has already cost the ISO two
participants and nearly 600 megawatts in its peaking program.
Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Enron (ENE) initially agreed to build peaking
plants for the ISO next summer, but withdrew their offers after the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission proposed capping the clearing price for
California's wholesale electricity market at $150 a megawatt-hour.
The ISO, which operates one of the state's wholesale power markets and
manages most of the high-voltage transmission grid, has already solicited
and received bids from merchant generators for 1,800 megawatts of new
peaking power for next summer.
Burned by the summer's power crisis and facing an 8,000-MW shortfall next
summer, the ISO put out a request for bids in August. The ISO's board voted
Oct. 30 to enter into the contracts, which it estimated would cost about
$250 million a year for three years.
The state's Electricity Oversight Board, which oversees the performance of
the ISO, and the Public Utilities Commission protested the decision on the
grounds that the contracts were too expensive.
The commission is also questioning whether there is even a need for peaking
power next summer and, if there is, whether the ISO should handle the
solicitation.
""The question also arises as to whether the ISO - which is empowered only
to operate the state's transmission system and which does not represent the
state or its consumers - is the appropriate organization to plan, solicit
and pay for the construction of new power plants across the state,"" the
commission wrote in its Nov. 2 order.
Ind the end, the decision is up to state regulators. If utilities can come
up with a cheaper alternative and if the regulators determine that
additional generation is needed by next summer, then they will follow
through with the utilities proposal.","[('ISO', 10), ('The', 9), ('summer', 8)]"

from the TFA national board members residing in Houston. TFA-H is enjoying
incredible momentum right now--so much so that we are once again in dire
need of computers. We have made contact with several companies and have some
corporate proposals under consideration, but those are ""down the road""
relationships assuming they work out as planned.   Please reach out to
anyone and everyone to make them aware of TFA-Houston and how much the
contribution of retired computers means to the disadvantaged neighborhoods
and schools that we serve.  We have a request in to Exxon Mobil Upstream
Research as I understand Exxon is replacing 40K desktops with laptops.  I
haven't been able to make headway with Exxon Mobil yet--if you can assist
with trying to obtain their retired computers, that would excellent.  This
could help our efforts across the country.

UPDATE:  We have now assisted 74 organizations and have a backlog of demand.
This Saturday, November 11, we will provide 75 computers to 4 organizations.
This will deplete our inventory.  We have several partnerships in the making
that will greatly increase the demand for our services. This week I also
participated in a meeting headed by the Mayor's office to bring the
technology and economic providers of the Enhanced Enterprise Community
together to see how we can effectively collaborate.  Judging by the interest
of my post-meeting conversations, this will also generate considerable
demand for our services.  We want to be able to deliver what we say we can
since we are now moving to the forefront of digital divide efforts in
Houston.

Thank you for your commitment and willingness to serve the cause of
eliminating the digital divide in Houston!   We are making a difference in
the lives of thousands of children and their families--let's keep moving
forward. I have attached an information sheet that you can use if you need
it as well as a list of the equipment we can use.   I have also included an
update of the progress of TFA-Houston.  Please email or call if you have
questions.

Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker

""I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have
reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me
feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.

""The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests
with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the
taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no
way reflect my own personal beliefs.

""My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and
transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this
issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious
views from his professional conduct?

""I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue
to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau
in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law
enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I
have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong
support to continue.

""The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal
religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status
if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability
to perform their professional responsibilities.

""Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he
is ""out of step with Portland"" could be used in other Oregon communities to
fire more liberal public officials who are ""out of step"" with their
community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both
ways.

""Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He
assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo
the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than
just walk away.

""He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.
He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.

""He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of
all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

""He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson
to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a ""gay disease.""

""He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual
Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.

""He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.

""In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will
work to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our
sense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's
personal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and
to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.

""As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me.""

		 Subject: Energy investing...brainstorming and perspective sharing between 
Vanguard Ventures and Enron...

Many thanks for meeting with Bob and I last week.
How ironic to find you working with one of my 
graduate school classmates, Gene Humphrey.

As we discussed, Vanguard is interested in exploring
what kinds of opportunities may exist for venture 
investment in the energy arena.  We think that
the ultimate ""internet (and everything) infrastructure"" play is about clean,
always on, electrical power.  While we are not experts in the area,
and are not yet certain it will be a productive area for venture
capital investment of the type Vanguard does, we feel 
that there is a sufficient market need in multiple segments that 
there MAY be such an investment opportunity which it
would make sense for us to pursue as an investment
focus area.  This could have value for Enron should
we determine investment areas which are symbiotic
with Enron and which we could collaborate on, as we
help catalyze/create/fund exciting new companies.

As we discussed we would love to participate in a brainstorming and 
perspective setting session with visionary and strategic Enron executives
who
have domain knowledge and an interest. Our potential interest areas span 
from generation (alternatives, distributed, and conventional) 
to transmission to distribution to storage...fixed and mobile.  
We appreciate your offer to pull together an Enron group for such 
a brainstorming...and I would be quite happy to fly down to 
Houston again in order to engage in such a session.

As always we appreciate your interest in Vanguard.

Best,

attached document. We've basically kept the same schedule except for
October. Michael Capellas is joining the Business Council, which will meet
during our former time for the October meeting. All directors but one were
available the third week in October.

We're still trying to improve attendance for the two-day strategy meeting in
the summer. Please send us your availability for June 27-28 or June 28-29.
If we move to June, the July meeting would be one day only--July 26.

In addition, we would like to claim dates for our 2002 Board meetings as
most of your calendars are very busy and tend to fill up fast. In the past
our Board meetings have been on the fourth Thursday of the first and third
month of the quarter, and the December meeting is usually held on the second
Thursday. Please review the dates on page 2 of the attached file and get

(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked 
other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.?

I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 
7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be 
dropped most easily are June or  September.? 
?
June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. 
because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new 
information is available.
?
I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq 
executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 
or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing 
earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the 
September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as 
exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 
members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to ""fill the  house"" in June.

Dear Gil:

Thank you for requesting information regarding my business.  First I am
pleased to be a new member of the US-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and look
forward to meeting you and the members.

I am an independent Real Estate Broker under my own name Paula A. McGowan
and
a CIPS (Certified International Property Specialist) located in Colorado
Springs, Colorado.  I have been active in Colorado Real Estate for the past
seven years and marketing Mexico property and assisting US/International
buyers since 1995.

The main purpose of my business is to assist inbound or outbound individuals
or companies who plan to invest or relocate to another country.  This
includes working with international professionals such as real estate
practitioners, attorneys, accountants, lenders or developers on their
behalf.
 I will assist companies wishing to locate production facilities in
Colorado,
Internationally or in Mexico such as the state of Sonora and will inquire
about government incentives to companies willing to relocate.  I also make
referrals to real estate practitioners and professionals in other countries.

I am a member of FIABCI, (The International Real Estate Federation) based in
France which provides me direct access to international real estate contacts
and professionals in over 55 countries throughout the world.  I am also a
member of The National Association of Realtors International, CIPS Network
which is a resource of hundreds of real estate practitioners who specialize
in international property practices throughout the globe. These
organizations
provide our members an avenue where we can market property for clients at
marketing sessions held during US and International conventions.  In
Colorado
I am a member of the Colorado Association of Realtors, the Pikes Peak
Association of Realtors and a member of the Broadmoor Golf Club.

When my parents moved to Mexico in the late 50's, my love of Mexico began.
I
made many trips to visit them, have close friends of 20 years in the Guaymas
area and know many of the business people.  My husband and I reside in San
Carlos, Sonora, Mexico part time.  We have been active in Mexico Senior Golf
Tournaments in Acapulco, Guadalajara and San Carlos during the past 14
years.
 We are past members of the Asociacion Mexicana A.C. De Golf Senior, the San
Carlos Country Club/Club de Golf de Guaymas and I am a member of Los
Recuerdos, a women's organization in San Carlos.

I presently market property in Guaymas, Sonora, Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, a
home in Guadalajara and a 320 acre ranch in Valle De Bravo, Mexico.  These
properties can be seen on my website at <A
HREF=""http://www.paulamcgowan.com"">

Please feel free to contact me if I can be of help to you or the members.

First off, I have a friend who is setting up a plant in Corcoran,
Northern Calif., to manufacture a welded reinforcement grid building
building structural systems.  They will need 480V/1200 amp. service.  I
suggested that they would be better off making an electricity provision
agreement with you rather than PG&E.

His name is Hans Bauman.  He can be reached at 949-640 2880.  Please
have your people contact him ASAP as he plans to open for business in
November.

Next, the Aspen Accord conference in Sweden went extraordinarily well
... especially with the California issues in such abound.  Commissioner
Wood was there along with the mayors etc. of the cities.  I know that
there is a business opportunity that can be developed and would be
pleased, when the timing is right to discuss this with you.  After all
Ken, your California experience should show that improvement in your
position in the marketplace could be better.

Why not, on your next trip to Aspen, give me a call and drop by Orange
County airport and I'll ride up with you.  We can talk about what I see
as lost opportunities and how to capture them.

My new life is going amazingly well.  I'm working in an advisory
capacity in California, Chicago and Sweden ... and taking time to 'smell
the roses'.  Hope you are doing the same.

Dear Family,
Heather and I were talking about NYC and thought we
should make some reservations for dinner for the
entire family on Friday and Saturday night. I am
trying to get reservations for the entire family at Le
Cirque 2000 for Friday night at 7:30 but we will be
very lucky to get in. Does anyone have other
suggestions or an objection to Le Cirque? I am
attaching a review of the restaurant. It is definitely
a little ""Haute"" but I've heard it is also a lot of
fun. Heather is looking into Italian restaurants for
Saturday night, as well.

This is just a suggestion but we were worried that we
may have difficutly getting into a good restaurant if
we wait too long. Also, I think I am just a little
excited about the trip!
Luv to all
Liz

The Verdict
The highest of the city's high-society restaurants.

Tip Sheet
One of New York's Best
Nominated for best dessert and for best French
restaurant, this aptly-named restaurant provides the
city's most carnivalesque dinner experience.
Can't Wait?
Peruse Le Cirque 2000's blockbuster wine list now.

Also Nominated for Best French Restaurant
Daniel, Chanterelle, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin

Also Nominated for Best Dessert
Gramercy Tavern, Payard Patisserie, Jean Georges, Park
Avenue Cafe

The Scene
Uber-designer Adam Tihany's (Jean Georges, among
others) surreal interior evokes simultaneous thoughts
of the Sistine Chapel and ""The Jetsons."" Purple,
one-armed velvet chairs, neon tubing and
stainless-steel sculptures compete for attention with
the soaring, gilded ceilings, pre-Raphaelite murals
and bejeweled patrons. Ringleader Sirio Maccioni
oversees a front-of-house that has won praise for
softening the haughty edge that marked the
restaurant's pre-Y2K incarnation.

The Food
Still some of the most sublime haute cuisine around.
Though longtime sous chef Sotta Kuhnn is now heading
the kitchen=01*having succeeded Sylvain Portay (who took
over for Daniel Boulud)=01*the luxurious,
truffle-and-foie-gras-studded fare remains as sharp as
ever. The current menu includes the long-running
paupiette of sea bass with Barolo sauce and leeks, as
well a sauteed veal chop with bacon-wrapped asparagus.
Patrons can take decision-making out of the picture
entirely with the five-course chef's degustation menu,
a bargain at $90.

Chairman & C.E.O. 
Enron Corporation 

Dear Dr. Lay: 

I am writing to bring your attention to an important and timely event that 
will be held on September 20th at the Hyatt Regency Columbus, in Columbus, 
Ohio - ""The Governors' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Challenge."" This 
event is convened by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC).? 
Co-chaired by Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, IOGCC Chairman and Ohio Governor 
Bob Taft, with the participation of other governors, this forum promises to 
be an outstanding exchange of ideas among leaders of government, energy 
producers, transporters, distributors, and end-users on the subject of the 
current and long-term outlook for natural gas resources and markets in North 
America. A very distinguished group of speakers is assembling, including 
senior government officials and senior executives of companies critically 
involved in the energy value chain.

Primary Goals of the Summit include: 

* Exploring and clearly communicating the current dynamics of the natural gas 
market 
* Informing the industry and the public about the current and future supply 
potential for gas 
* Providing governmental and industry leaders with an opportunity to discuss 
natural gas in the context of national energy policy, with the input of 
interested State Governors.

The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) and the governors have 
asked CERA to help organize the Summit and has invited senior CERA staff to 
moderate panel discussions on the Natural Gas Marketplace and the Supply 
Response for North America. In addition, I will be providing an opening 
framework for participants and contributing to the wrap-up of the Summit at 
the close of the day with the governors.? We are very pleased to be working 
with the governors and with the IOGCC and its executive director, Christine 
Hansen.

We hope that you can join us for this important event, and encourage you to 
view the Summit agenda on the IOGCC Web-site at: 
http://www.iogcc.state.ok.us/MEETINGS/2000_Governors_Natural_Gas_Summit.htm? 

On this site, you will also find complete registration information including 
fees, registration form, and logistics. 

You may also be interested in a recent Washington Post article on volatility 
in the gas and power markets, which helps provide a context for the 
discussion and which was co-authored by CERA Managing Director Tom Robinson 
and myself. This article may be found on the Washington Post Web-site at: 
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18653-2000Jul20.html 

Should you have any questions regarding the Summit or CERA's participation, 
please contact my colleague Ron Kapavik at +1 936 931 1416 or via e-mail to

From:         Lou Cordia
Date:         November 13, 2000
Re:            President Bush or President Gore?

Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney won on election night by getting
more votes in Florida than Gore/Lieberman.

Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney won when the election night vote
was confirmed by an official recount in Florida.

The only legitimate remaining ballots to be counted are those from Floridians
who reside overseas, who post-marked their ballots on or before November 7th,
and whose ballots are received on or before November 17th.

However, it is obvious that Gore/Lieberman are trying to steal the election.
Like the Clinton/Gore's years of public relations and legal distortions, 
Gore/Lieberman
are looking for a ""governing legal authority"" to increase their probability 
of victory.
They want four counties in Florida where Democrats significantly out-register 
Republicans
to hand-count their ballots; and let the Democrats in charge of the recounts 
""objectively""
decide what was in the mind of the voter when he/she did not completely punch 
the ballot.
For example, if someone partially punched a hole in a ballot because he/she 
started to vote
for Gore and then decided in the booth not to vote him or anyone, these 
Democrats would
give the vote to Gore - that's according to the second set of rules, as 
changed during the
recount in Palm Beach County.  Incidently, but not surprisingly, all three of 
these Palm
Beach officials are Democrats.

What Gore/Lieberman Campaign Chairman Richard Daley is orchestrating is as 
outrageous
as what his father did in 1960 in Cook County Illinois in stealing the 
election from John Kennedy.

Point blank, Al Gore is not as honorable as Richard Nixon was in 1960 and 
Gerald Ford was
in 1976 when both Republican candidates conceded the close elections despite 
campaign
advisors' requests for recounts.  They put the interests of the country ahead 
of their own
personal interest in the White House.  They knew then that recounting ad 
infinitum would
produce pluses and minuses in vote counts; but they trusted that the votes 
would balance
out if all precincts were recounted.  They believed in the integrity of our 
elections, and knew
of the adverse consequences here and abroad of second-guessing our election 
process.

If you are as upset as I am, then please help by making a contribution to the 
Bush/Cheney
Recount Fund that has been set up to fight the Gore/Lieberman trial lawyers 
and public
relations spin- miesters.

I am enclosing an admittedly less emotionally-charged letter from Bush/Cheney 
Campaign
Chairman Don Evans and a response form.  Please HELP TODAY.

To:     Mr. Louis J. Cordia

From:  Donald L. Evans
           Chairman, Bush-Cheney Campaign

Date:  November 11, 2000

You were there when we began this campaign and we appreciate all that you have
done.  I would like to ask for your help one more time on behalf of Governor 
Bush
and Secretary Cheney.

It is now clear we must have the funding necessary to fight this legal battle 
in Florida.
Governor Bush won on Election Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, 
the other
side is seeking yet a third count by hand.

The law allows us to open a ""recount fund"" which we have done this morning.  
This
expensive legal process must be funded immediately.  We need you to overnight 
a check
for $5000, made payable to Bush-Cheney Recount.  Please see the delivery 
instructions
on the next page.

The check must come from personal funds.  No corporate contributions are 
allowed.
The contribution does not count against your annual federal giving limit of 
$25,000.
We are not required to make these donations public.  However, in keeping with 
Governor
Bush's ""full disclosure"" policy on financial contributions, these 
contributions will be posted
on the Bush-Cheney website.

We respectfully ask that you limit the amount of your check to $5000.  Should 
we have
funds left over, we will refund them to each donor on a pro rata basis.  If 
you have any
questions regarding this contribution, you may contact Jack Oliver or Jeanne 
Johnson
Phillips at (512) 344-4601.

Throughout the past two years, your friendship and support has meant a great 
deal to
Governor Bush and to me personally.  We thank you in advance for your 
willingness to
help us during this important time in the life of our country.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards.

Mr. Nicholas (Nick) Tell, Managing Director of the Trust Company of the West 
(TCW) has invited Enron Global Fuels to attend a meeting on Wednesday, 
November 29 at 3:00pm at the Orion Refinery in Norco, La. with the following 
individuals:

Mr. David Matlin, Managing Director Workouts & Special Situations of Credit 
Suisse/First Boston
Mr. George Sutherland, Vice President Commercial of Orion Refining Corp.
Mr. Clark Johnson, President of Orion Refining Corp. (formerly with Frontier)
Mr. Nicholas Tell

The purpose of this meeting is to follow up on a meeting with CSFB last week 
and a conversation with Mr. Tell today to explore opportunities between Enron 
and Orion. These opportunities may include crude oil supply, refined products 
offtake, risk management services and possible financing of refinery 
improvements that may be repaid in products rather than cash. 

Note--ownership of this refinery is broken out as follows--CSFB (68%), 
Jefferies (18%), TCW (10%) and Oaktree (4%). Jack Stanley is totally out of 
the picture. The refinery is currently running at 145,000 bpd and is badly in 
need of a reformer which would be at least a 15 month project.

******E-NEWS THIS WEEK*******

KVAERNER WINS BALAL AWARD
Tehran - Kvaerner Singapore, part of the Anglo-Norwegian group, has been
appointed detailed engineering contractor for the offshore production
platform in the Balal oil field, being developed by TotalFinaElf. The award
follows Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction (OIEC) and Singapore's
SembCorp winning the $60m contract for installation of the platform to
process 40,000bbl/d of oil and 14mcfd of associated gas.
The Anglo-Norwegian group was brought in by NIOC subsidiary Petro Pars in
April to manage the first phase development of South Pars gas field. In a
separate development, OIEC and Petro Iran are reported to be looking for a
foreign partner to take a 30% stake in the $850m Salman offshore project,
which the two Iranian companies won in October on a buy-back basis. The
Salman contract, tendered in 1998, requires the rebuilding of war-damaged
facilities and upgrading production at the field by 45,000 bbl/d to 130,000
bbl/d as well as developing an associated gas structure. http://www.irna.com


OPEC TO SUSPEND 20-DAY MECHANISM UNTIL JANUARY
Vienna - OPEC exporters have rejected calls from consuming nations for
further extra crude supplies that would have helped ease stubbornly high
world oil prices and cut fuel bills this winter. It appears, as the
Ministers meet in Austria this month, that OPEC will not be adding further
increases to world supplies despite oil prices remaining outside its
automatic 20-day production increase mechanism, set at $22-28/bbl. 'There
will be no increases this year under any circumstances,' Indonesian Oil
Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro told awaiting reporters after a two-hour
meeting ahead of the formal ratification of the decision.
http://www.opec.org/


SUDAN SIGN EXPLORATION AGREEMENT
Khartoum - Sudan has signed an oil exploration agreement with several local
and international companies for an area in central Sudan, the
government-owned Al-Anbaa newspaper reported on Sunday. 'Sudan has signed a
production agreement...covering prospecting, development and transportation
of oil with Gulf oil companies, the Chinese National Petroleum Corp, Al Than
and Sudapet,' the daily said.
Al-Anbaa said the agreement covered a 75sq.km area on the western bank of
the White Nile, south of the town of Rabak, about 275km south of Khartoum.
The Gulf companies hold a 46% stake in the investment, the Chinese company
has 23%, Al Than also has 23% and Sudapet holds 8%.
Sudan, which produces about 185,000 barrels per day of crude oil, began
crude exports in August 1999. It had previously been importing oil and oil
products for about $300m a year, eating up most of its export earnings. It
has also been reported this week that Talisman Energy are to step up their
exploration efforts in the country, despite opposition from humanitarian
groups.


SHELL INK EGYPTIAN GTL AGREEMENT
Cairo - Royal Dutch/Shell Group confirmed this week that they are to invest
$1.7bn in an Egyptian gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant that could lead the country
to use domestic gas reserves to satisfy its entire oil products market for
more than 50 years.
Egypt is currently an importer of oil products. The oil giant agreed to
initial terms on the deal early in October. Shell said it has now signed a
development protocol with Egyptian General Petroleum for a
75,000-barrel-per-day GTL conversion plant to convert natural gas into
synthetic fuels. Crucially the project is now said to have the backing of
Egyptian Petroleum Minister Sameh Fahmy. Production could be in place by
late 2005, while a plant at the same site producing liquefied natural gas
(LNG) could be up and running earlier, by mid-2004.

and executive assistant telephones and workspaces for listening devices.  
This sweep included your telephone(s).
 
On Thursday, November 9, the following tests were conducted by Swailes and 
Associates and CTF Specialists under the supervision of Corp. Security:

Each office was swept for radio frequency listening devices
Each telephone was opened and physically inspected
Each telephone line was checked for downline listening devices
All executive and assistant extensions were programmatically evaluated to 
determine whether secondary, unknown telephones were associated with the same 
extension

No problems were found.

They offered Enron an opportunity to invest in a patented method of 
generating electricity by converting methane to hydrogen and burning hydrogen 
in a high efficiency turbine.  This patent represents an idea, without any 
exhaustive quantitative analysis or research and without any prototype 
demonstrated in the field or a lab.

We politely told Mr. Hatchett that we would review his proposal and get back 
to him.

Subsequently, we conveyed to Mr. Hatchett that a) methane consumption rate 
for an integrated facility based on the subject patent is higher than the 
conventional plant efficiency b) the result in fuel cost is higher c) the 
overall Co2 emissions are probably higher d) there is no economical or 
technical justification to support an investment of Enron funds.  

We informed Bob Hatchett that we would recommend to Enron that Enron not 
invest in the development of this effort.  While we invited Mr. Hatchett to 
respond back to us regarding our analysis, I see no further action required 
by us at this time.

Please let me know if you want us to draft anything from you to Mr. Hatchett 
regarding this subject.

ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
November 2000, Number 11


CRITICAL ASPECTS OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
Sidney Weintraub

When the word ""globalization"" is uttered, it evokes two contradictory 
visceral reactions: it is either the essential element of recent U.S. 
competitiveness; or it is inherently evil because the global spread of 
multinational corporations enriches the wealthy and economically powerful at 
the expense of the vast multitude of workers. In what follows, I will avoid 
both attacks and praise, and instead focus on key features of international 
trade and investment that characterize what is taking place in much of the 
world.

A country, if its dictatorial leader so insists, can set its own prohibitive 
tariff and import structure and reject foreign investment. North Korea and 
Vietnam, both nondemocratic, did this for many years, despite the horrible 
cost this policy imposed on national welfare. This isolation is breaking down 
in these two countries, even as it did earlier in China after the death of 
Mao, and for much the same reason. Eternal poverty is not a good formula for 
regime continuity.

Guarding economic sovereignty did not take the same absolutist form in most 
other countries, but a profound transformation is taking place in them as 
well. Import barriers are coming down and attacks against foreign investment 
are being transmuted into searches to attract foreign investment. Mexico, 
before its debt collapse in 1982, favored external borrowing over investment 
to obtain foreign exchange, but learned to its dismay that this practice 
contained its own risks when the debt could not be serviced. The philosophic 
base of development then changed and foreign investment was actively sought 
as an essential requirement for Mexico to augment its exports. This outlook 
was the premise of NAFTA. Hugo Ch?vez, the president of Venezuela, rails 
against primitive neoliberalism (neoliberalismo salvaje), but nevertheless 
has kept the country's import tariffs relatively low, even as he makes a 
great effort to obtain foreign direct investment to develop his country's 
telecommunications and natural gas activities. Ch?vez, so far, has shown a 
tendency to talk like a Marxist, much like Fidel Castro, his romantic icon, 
but then act like a capitalist.

For many of the world's poorest countries, the primordial problem is not the 
spread of multinational corporations, but their inability to participate in 
the process. This is especially true in sub-Saharan Africa. Their poverty, 
small internal markets, and accompanying political instability make them poor 
destinations for foreign investment, other than to exploit minerals for 
export. This does not lead to substantial job creation.

Both foreign direct investment and international trade are growing more 
rapidly than world economic growth. This is a clear manifestation that the 
""foreign"" aspect of the world economy is becoming increasingly important. If 
one looks back only 20 years, when the dominant economic model in Latin 
America was to develop behind high import barriers and to downplay the 
importance of exports, it is startling how much development thinking has 
changed in that part of the world. East Asia, with its export orientation, 
became the model, and not the preachings of those who advised Latin America 
to look inward.

The bulk of the world's trade is carried on by large corporations. This is 
not a new phenomenon. These same corporations are large investors in foreign 
manufacturing and service activities. Indeed, the two phenomena-investing and 
producing in foreign countries and then selling much of the output in still 
other foreign countries, as well as the home market-are inseparable.

International trade is increasingly taking place in intermediate rather than 
final products-chips for computers, parts for office machinery, engines for 
automobiles and trucks, cotton and wool fabrics for apparel. Look under the 
hood of your car; the transmission assembly may have elements produced in a 
number of countries. The assembly line in Detroit works on a just-in-time 
basis to receive the material needed from across the border in Windsor, 
Ontario-and beware of a slowdown from a customs snafu that leads to a costly 
disruption in the manufacturing process.

This goes by the name coproduction. The parts are produced in a variety of 
locations, assembled in other places, and sold globally. Much of the sales 
are within the same multinational corporation, say, from a parent to a 
subsidiary (intra-firm trade), or within the same sector (intra-industry 
trade). As goods pass across borders in this fashion, the absence of border 
impediments (tariffs, lengthy inspection delays) is crucial, as the 
automotive example between Windsor and Detroit exemplifies. Hence, the drive 
for trade negotiations to lower these barriers and the proliferation of 
regional economic integration agreements, such as NAFTA, to legally ensure 
the absence of delays in a just-in-time world.

Economic integration and, by extension, the process of globalization, is 
centered on competition in particular sectors when it comes to production and 
merchandise trade. What is taking place is a form of division of labor-Adam 
Smith on a regional and global scale. The global aspect is made possible by 
technology, advances in communication and transportation, and by financing 
far more vast than anything seen before. Corporations take many factors into 
account when setting up complementary plants in foreign countries, such as 
size of the domestic market, the availability and price of labor, the cost of 
transportation, and the political stability of the country where the 
investment is made. The growth of U.S. coproduction with Mexico was based 
primarily on two considerations: proximity, and thus low transportation 
costs; and inexpensive labor. Most foreign direct investment is made among 
industrial countries, which is evidence that cheap labor is by no means 
always the dominant criterion. This is evident as well from the paucity of 
investment in the world's poorest countries.

If most international trade is conducted by large corporations, what does 
this imply for the future of small and medium-sized enterprises? In just 
about all countries, goods and services that are not internationally traded 
are more voluminous than tradables. In addition, many large corporations have 
concluded that making all inputs in-house is not the most efficient practice 
and instead are subcontracting to independent producers and service 
providers-and many of these are relatively small enterprises. Their products 
are then exported indirectly, via the exports of the large corporations.

There is no intent in this discussion to assert that multinational 
corporations invariably provide their workers with optimal working conditions 
and good salaries and are always careful to avoid environmental degradation 
in their operations. We know that many corporations are not that meticulous, 
even though we also know that wages and working conditions in foreign 
transplants generally are superior to those of domestic enterprises. We know 
that foreign trade and investment results in losers in the home countries, 
although by now it is clear that there are many more winners. We know that 
the global spread of business benefits some countries more than others and 
that some regions of countries prosper while others lag behind. The 
globalization genie-in the form of investment, trade, financial flows, and 
technology advances-is out of the bottle. The challenges are to minimize the 
downside dangers while exploiting the upside benefits that globalization can 
offer to countries throughout the world.

who either have expressed interest in serving on the transition team or who I 
would like to approach to serve on the transition team for Bush.  We believe 
that a call from you to Cheney may be required.

David Haug.    David will be returning from his honeymoon on Dec 4 and has 
expressed a strong interest in serving on the Bush team.
Woody Wodraska.  Woody would like to work on environmental and water issues 
and has been in touch with Bush campaign folks in both California and 
Florida.  He would appreciate a call on his behalf to Cheney.  Amanda is 
aware of his interest and is amenable to his service.
James Steffes.  You know Jim.  He is one of the most creative and talented 
people in my organization.  He is familiar with state and federal energy 
regulation as well as the state and federal policy makers who have played an 
active role in deregulation efforts.  He would be great to have on a vetting 
team for commission nominees.  I have talked to Jim and he is interested.
Others.  We can make another 4 people available from the government affairs 
organization with qualifications in energy, communications and market 
regulation.  The question is more a matter of how many Enron people they 
would like to have.  Among them:  Dan Allegretti (who will be chair of NEPOOL 
next year) who campaigned for Bush in New Hampshire; and Sue Landwehr, a 
republican who works for us in the upper midwest.


Linda Robertson has suggested that we try to put as many people on the 
""vetting"" team as possible.  Let me know how I need to proceed.","[('people', 5), ('would', 5), ('team', 5)]"

Subject: Azurix and OPIC

Joe
 I want to give you a heads up on a serious issue that has developed between 
Azurix and OPIC. There is no action requested from you but I wanted you to be 
aware of this development.

 Last spring we encouraged Azurix to look to OPIC and IDB for funding support 
for the financing needed for their Argentinian concession for the province of 
Buenos Aires.  For the past several months teams from Azurix and the two 
lending agencies have been moving forward with the expectation that we could 
go to an OPIC Board vote in September for $100 million and to the IDB Board 
in October for $150 million.

 Everything was going along great until last friday.  Early last week OPIC 
had its credit committee review and approve the project, though apparently 
some members were concerned about the regulatory risk associated with water 
projects. (This would be OPIC's first financing of a water project.)   Friday 
AM, George Munoz recieved a draft cable from the US Embassy in Argentina 
providing their assessment of the project and, on the spot, pulled the 
project from Investment Committee and off the calendar for consideration by 
the OPIC Board in September.  Friday afternoon, OPIC staff informed Azurix 
and our office in a meeting that Azurix should be resorting to ""Plan B"", 
implying that the project would not go forward in the foreseeable future.  
OPIC would not provide Azurix or us with the cable. 

 Over the weekend, the cable was formally sent to Washington, though now 
reclassified as a classified document so we have not been able to see its 
contents.  Moreover, the Ambassador has specifically conveyed his directive 
to Washington that the cable is not to be shown to anyone outside of the 
government,   John Garrison has a relationship with the Ambassador but has 
not been able to get the Embassy to alter its position, nor would I think 
they be inclined to do so now given the fact that they could have 
disassociated themselves from the draft on friday but did not.

 On the positive side, the InterAmerican Development Bank has stated that 
they are prepared to consider increasing the size of the B loan to cover the 
additional $100 million.   We have met with the IDB and discussed the 
situation at OPIC; they seem satisfied at this point.

 It appears to me that George Munoz is unwilling to take to the Board the 
Azurix project when a damning cable has been circulated around the government 
even if the substance of the cable is exaggerated, taken out of context and 
distorted.  From what we have learned, the cable containes concerns expressed 
about the regulatroy framework, labor issues etc., etc., but also comments 
from the Argentinian goverment about Azurix and the concession about Bahia 
Blanca and the politics of Azurix in Argentina. It is uncompromisingly 
negative in its tone.

 Azurix is seeking a return of  the $250,000 fee and will withdraw its 
application.

 Hope all is well.  John

Steven J Kean,US Chamber,"Sun, 19 Nov 2000 12:11:00 -0800 (PST)","You had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from Tom 
Donahue regarding increasing Enron's contribution to the US Chamber to 
$100,000.  I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and 
wanted you to know why.

I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year.  Donahue 
has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up, 
both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.  My 
reservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something 
which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it 
will alienate a vocal few.  Electric restructuring was a key example of 
this.  There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but 
instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they 
decided to have a ""process"".  Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to 
participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it 
came time to vote.  The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform 
(with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery).  Afterwards, the 
federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not 
exclusively the Chamber's fault).

Unfortunately, Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to 
raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a 
few members will be upset.  For Enron it's a bit like paying $100,000 for a 
veto right.  The only things the organization pushes for are the things 
everyone agrees on in the business community -- eg China PNTR and lower 
corporate taxes -- things they will push for whether we pay dues or not (and 
things we will add our separate voice to in any event).  

As I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging 
conventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating 
incumbents.  Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some 
members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with 
us.  They represent the status quo in the business community.  Tom is an 
extremely promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the 
business community.  A voice which stands for moving business to the next 
level, not just protecting its current position.

Having said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international chapters) 
has been useful to us in the past.  In previous years, Donahue himself has 
intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.  As a consequence, I 
have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members 
at a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access 
to their international activities.  I suggested something in the $25,000 
range.  That's why they are approaching you (they want us to double our 
current dues to $100,000).

Currently, I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership, but I plan 
to defer to Linda Robertson.  I am interested in your insights, or, if you 
prefer, you can simply refer them to Linda or me.","[('Chamber', 9), ('I', 8), ('business', 5)]"

Gary, 
Least I forget!  On N5737 the other day (11/18) Mr. Lay reported to Bill 
Reddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and he answers that it 
disconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported 
this problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.  We checked and there 
is no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) 
on all three Falcon 900's.

Lyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it 
disconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring 
it works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over 
today to check the system.

I know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've 
discussed this with Ron and John as well.

Peter E Weidler,Argentine devaluation exposure,"Mon, 20 Nov 2000 09:14:00 -0800 (PST)","Attached is an analysis of the probability of a devaluation in Argentina and 
the contractual protections TGS has in the event of a devaluation.  

Long and short of it is - 

Argentina's economy is primarily dollarized and it would appear that a 
devaluation would do considerable short term harm to the economy. 

Convertibility Law was enacted in 1991.  Large part of the population 
remembers the super inflation of 1989 and 1990.

To devalue the currency, Argentina would have to amend the Convertibility Law 
- this requires  approval of the Federal Congress.

TGS has numerous layers of protection from a devaluation - in addition to the 
Convertibility law, it has protection through its license and regulations.  
Indeed, as you remembered, the tariff is indexed to the exchange rate.

A concern is - to the extent the Government takes action as drastic as 
changing the Convertibility Law to implement a devaluation, and it is willing 
to suffer the short term economic and political harm of a devaluation - then 
there is a reasonable chance they would go the extra step and find a way 
delink the tariffs of the privatized regulated companies from the dollar.    
In this case Enron would have protection under the BIT treaty.

The impact on Enron's P&L is a function of whether or not we use the Peso as 
the functional currency.  If we use the Peso as the functional currency - 
Enron would have a signficant negative translation adjustment from a 
devaluation.  If we use the dollar as the functional currency - there would 
be no impact on our income statement.   I will research this further in order 
to ensure we can use the dollar as a our functional currency.

Paul and I met with Frank Savage, President & CEO of Alliance Capital
Managment International in NY today to see if he might be a good
prospect for the RFF Board.  Ken Lay arranged the meeting - Ken is on
the board of Howard University (where Frank is chair) and Frank is on
the Enron board.  Frank also knows Linda and John Deutch (from the
Council on Foreign Relations.)

We had a very good meeting - brought him upto speed on RFF and how we
are trying to expand our visability,esp in NY and in the financial
community, through events, the Council, etc.  Frank was very receptive
to our plans, thought we needed to focus on specific topics of interest
to the financial community and actions we could ask people to help
with.  He said he would love to come to Dod's breakfast in Feb.and
learn more about RFF.

Howard U. is clearly his biggest passion.  We need to send a letter
from Paul to him documenting previous conversations Paul has had with
folks at Howard about our fellowship programs and our desire to have
more African Americans apply.  He will show it to the President and
encourage him to act on it.)

Next step: Lesli ask Ken Lay to call Frank, see what he thought of us,
tell him more about his involvemnt on the Board, and see if Frank might
want to consider the Board over the next couple of months.","[('Frank', 7), ('RFF', 4), ('Ken', 3)]"

=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing
11/21/0 15:31 (New York)



      By Cheryl Devoe Kim
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron
Canada Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as
part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two
companies, according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.
  Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he
used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and
Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received
for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.
  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the
companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on
the status of the case.
  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of
provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny
breaking any rules or laws.
  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for
high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.
  ""They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market
design flaws,"" Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview.
   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame
  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every 
deregulating
market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.
  ""Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even
oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,
there have been investigations done,"" Palmer said.
  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets
investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the
first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.
  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion
is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.
  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's 
status.
Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard
from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week
with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.
  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers
noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 
with
unusual frequency.
  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power
for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount
of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes
before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power
needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to
meet demand.
   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed
  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and
Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:
  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two 
minutes
later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,
but at a ""significantly higher price,"" according to the warrant application.
Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its
offer.
  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas
trading group, found that ""as a result of restatements, involving mostly
Powerex and Enron,"" the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to
between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and
10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.
  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom,
concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the
power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the
higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume
offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be
needed, and every participant would get the higher price.
  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by
the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or
that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.
  ""And we're adamant about that,"" Peterson said. ""There was no deal with 
Enron.
There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a
change in prices or anything like that.""
  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's
risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,
Peterson said.
  ""Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments 
of
Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,
Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced
unit,"" according to the warrant application.
  Peterson's response: ""We're operating in a very tight market there and we
felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta.""
  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.
  ""It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we
could sell it at,"" Enron's Thode said. ""And that's what Enron and every other
company does that's in the business of trading.""
  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, 
1999,
and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,
essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public
its investigation into Powerex and Enron.
  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the
investigation.
  ""Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the
interests and activities of market participants,"" he said.
  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at
the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't
likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada
""there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to
inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power.""
  Companies Concerned About Reputations
  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex
reputation.
  ""Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at
stake from a reputational point of view,"" Peterson said. ""Both companies, I
believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are
difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and
California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a
possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved.""
  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of
Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,
linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market
surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

with additional comments on the issues and procedures.  I also had
perspective from Nancy Peretsman, who couldn't participate in the call.
There are some differing views, I know, but let me suggest the following
next steps.

First, Tim Koller and I will prepare two things to send around:

1)  A list of the key issues, together with either (a) a suggested stance
for the panel on each; or (b) a clear statement of the different approaches
we could take.

2)  An elaborated treatment of the ""intangibles"" issue, together with more
examples and a shaper definition of a proposed recommendation.

On the basis of these two papers, we will ask each of you to e-mail or fax
your comments to me, and I will circulate the entire package of views to
everyone on the panel.

Tim and I will then prepare an agenda for a face-to-face meeting for late
January or early February.  This will give us time to digest the comments,
talk to one another, etc.  Based on the comments you send me, as well as any
subsequent discussions we have, we will also be able to prepare another
draft report for the meeting, no doubt with several bracketed parts that
will include questions for the group.

I am not sure if you are aware of the recent statements by the Prime
Minister of Canada, on his recent political trip to Whitehorse, Yukon.  He
made some erroneous statements regarding Canada's position on the ANGTS
project and Canada's requirements for any project.

The attached Official Background brief was issued by the PMO (Prime
Minister's Office) in Ottawa.  As you can see from the brief, Canada does
not agree that Foothills or the ANGTS project has exclusivity on a project
for delivering gas from Alaska.  Furthermore, Canada will ensure that any
project in the north will give maximum economic benefit to northerners.

I hope you find the attached document informative.  If you have any further

Attached is the draft agenda and participant list for Davos.

Our Europe government affairs group felt that it would be best if you spoke 
on energy liberalization and globalization with gas and electricity rather 
than one of the other topics since it has more direct implications for our 
profit centers.  If you would rather switch to another panel after you look 
at the agenda, please do so and let me know.

Dear Doug, dear Rosalee,

Please find attached the preliminary programme for the Energy Governors
Meeting.  The programme is based on the discussions held during the
preparatory meeting last month.  We were delighted that Enron was
represented.  Thanks for all you input Doug!  For you information, I have
also attached the list of confirmed participants to date.

Doug, based on your last e-mail, we would like to invite Dr Lay to speak in
the session ""Globalization and Liberalization"" on Monday afternoon.  Please
let me know if you agree and if either you or Rosalee could check with him
to see if he is of the same opinion and if he accepts, I would greatly
appreciate this.  Or let me know if he would prefer to speak in another
session.

Rosalee, we have Dr Lay already confirmed for two sessions within the main
Annual Meeting programme, the B-2-B session and ""The shape of the 21st
Century Corporation""  as soon as I know the exact dates and times - I will
let you know immediately in order to re-confirm.

I would like to fly to Atlanta and back on Friday, December 22, with our

Of course, we would only secure a plane if it is NOT needed for business

First of all HAPPY THANKSGIVING.  We Talked about you and how improtant our
family is on several occasions during the last few days. Hope your
Thanksgiving was as wonderful as ours. Jon Christopher, Mike, Nina, and
Elizabeth were here ( Columbia) for Thanksgiving. As usual, we talked, ate,
and enjoyed each other. It has become a family tradition to go to
Shakespeares Pizza, Ernies (ERNWAS) Steakhouse, and Booches (Hamburgers)
everytime any family member comes. Nina cooked some Russian quisine. The
weather was fairly decent for Missouri Thanksgiving (dry, 30 - 50 F).
Elizabeth saw Rugrats in Paris. Dalmations , and went to the parks. We
stayed behind and did other things including watching ""Hurricane"", a very
powerful movie.  Today we have been taking care of all those errands and
routines that are necessary after a weekend of company. We had a good time.


I talked to Ruby last evening. She has probably telephoned both of you by
now. She is sending some cookies to all of us, mostly using Mother's
recipes. How thankful I am to still have her.  And she seems to be in good
health. She is always so positive. She says that the second week in August
is probably the best weekend for the family reunion at our place in Crane
next year.  That would be August 11. How would that be for the two of you?
It would be fine with us. If you are in agreement I will send out the
invitations soon. If not, let me know so I can change it as you are two
important people for us and for the whole family.

We will be going to Thailand on February 5 and returning on March 4. I will
give you all numbers etc where we can be reached. We will have an apartment
in Bangkok but will be all over the Country. Karl and Ila Kruse will be with
us for two weeks. We are really looking forward to it.

Ken and Linda, we really enjoyed seeing you in Columbia. As usual you were
at your  best.

Sharon, We are having our usual big Christmas party on December 23. Any
chance you would be coming to Columbia? We would sure love to have you if
you
 can.
Ken We discussed getting together in Dec. That may not be possible because
of all of our schedules. If not lets look at jAN. For both of you, what does
your schedule look like?
Thats all for now. Let me know about the family reunion date (Sat, Aug. 11)
as soon as possible. Talk to you soon. Love. Bonnie","[('We', 9), ('family', 6), ('would', 5)]"

Background:
In 1986 while I was taking a graduate course in Economics as part of my MBA=

Economics and Thermodynamics. In 1988, I discussed my initial thoughts with=

A fourth paper entitled ""Innovation: Why"" is under preparation. In this=20
paper, we are able to substantiate  based on the concept of  the Capital=20

can see why I chose these two words in the title of the paper from my Enron=
=20
world.

I have been collaborating with Professor Oweiss on my own time and I am=20
pleased that we managed to get to this point. Professor Oweiss and I are no=

convinced that we have reached some breakthroughs that could revolutionize=
=20
the study of Economics. We also feel that we can build further on what we=

reached, and even making more valuable contributions.

I am sure that you will be pleased to learn of the above, of course being a=
n=20

As I reach this critical stage on our path of this research project,  I wou=

like to seek Enron support in two areas:

I.   Patent(s) / Copy Righting:
     I feel that the contributions that are covered in the three papers are=
=20
original and may warrant patenting / copy righting.=20
     Since I am the primary author of these papers I wanted to have some=20
credit go to Enron.

II.  Grant / Sponsorship:
     I feel that my endeavors which have been purely on my own personal tim=
e=20
so far, need to be replaced by a more concerted effort now that we have=20
reached a =20
     critical mass. Towards this end, Dr. Oweiss and myself are taking step=
s=20
to get funding from the National Science Foundation for a joint research=20
project that=20

     I do not know of any particular programs within Enron that would affor=

     I feel that such a research program will be very valuable.  I am furth=

David has submitted the following questions in advance of the interview:

What did critics say when Enron proposed to create a natural gas trading=20

those matters?
Tell me about the planning of EnronOnline. Whose idea was it? How did you=

GE's Jeffrey R. Immelt=20
His Focus On The Customer Boosted Him To The Top=20
By Patrick Seitz
Investor's Business Daily
Jeffrey R. Immelt, the man chosen to succeed the legendary Jack Welch as=20
chief executive of General Electric Co., knows there's just one person=20
keeping him in business: the customer. And that customer is the person Imme=
lt=20
goes all-out to please.
Immelt, 44, was plucked from the company's fast-growing GE Medical Systems=
=20
business, where he had served as president and chief executive since 1997.=
=20
The $7 billion unit, based in Waukesha, Wis., is a world leader in medical=
=20
diagnostic technology and information systems.
Immelt attributes much of his success to his laserlike focus on sales.
""I love working with customers. . . . Sales has really influenced everythin=
g=20
I do. It has instilled in me the important traits of operating with a sense=
=20
of urgency and listening to people,"" Immelt said.
Immelt on Monday was named president and chairman-elect of GE. He will=20
succeed John F. ""Jack"" Welch Jr., GE's chairman and CEO, when Welch retires=
=20
at the end of 2001.
When Immelt landed at GE Medical Systems in 1997, he quickly showed a knack=
=20
for squeezing growth from a unit known for sluggish sales. Last year, its=
=20
revenue jumped 23% to $6 billion.
Customers credit Immelt with going way beyond sales. When Chicago's=20
Northwestern Memorial Hospital expanded its scanning services last year,=20
Immelt spent hours helping to manage its work flow.
""That's the kind of collaboration that we find unusual,"" Northwestern=20
Memorial CEO Gary Mecklenburg told Business Week.
Immelt has proven himself both by turning around troubled GE divisions and=
=20
extracting better performance from thriving units.
Immelt knows how important it is to set the pace, not follow it. To keep GE=
=20
Medical flourishing, he's pushed the unit to expand acquisitions and new=20
product offerings. The division's product line ranges from ultrasound devic=
es=20
used in doctors' offices to multimillion-dollar CT and MRI scanners.
In his earlier work in GE's Plastics division, Immelt stood out by persuadi=
ng=20
hard-boiled carmakers to substitute plastics for metal on some parts.
As vice president of consumer service for GE's Appliances division, Immelt=
=20
deftly handled the fallout from a recall of refrigerator compressors. To ke=
ep=20
workers' morale pumped up during the recall, Immelt would often climb up on=
 a=20
forklift in GE's Louisville, Ky., plant and pass out words of encouragement=
=20
and praise. He took time to speak with employees during such sessions,=20
listening carefully to their ideas and concerns.
Immelt believes that open, fast communication with workers is crucial. Not =
a=20
table-thumper, he meets with employees =01) sometimes hundreds at a time =
=01) to=20
discuss where GE Medical is going. Colleagues say he works at=20
consensus-building, urging others to understand different points of view.
After returning from corporate meetings, Immelt distills the latest GE=20
thinking on videotape, and copies are sent to offices around the world.
Understanding that seeing someone face to face helps foster stronger=20
relationships, Immelt also travels often to meet employees and customers.=
=20
Constant contact keeps a company united, Immelt believes. So he updates the=
=20
company's employees once a week via e-mail on the latest developments =01) =
new=20
business, lost sales opportunities and other nuggets about company=20
initiatives. E-mail is sent in five languages, and at times up to a dozen,=
=20
according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Immelt was one of three GE executives who analysts considered possible=20
successors to Welch. Welch, 65, has been at the helm of the Fairfield,=20
Conn.-based finance, industrial and broadcasting powerhouse for the past tw=
o=20
decades.=20
""Jeff Immelt is a natural leader, and ideally suited to lead GE for many=20
years,"" Welch said. ""He brings a keen strategic intellect, a cutting-edge=
=20
technological background, strong leadership characteristics and a unique se=
t=20
of team-building skills.""
Knowing that preparation is key to long-term success, Immelt has long been=
=20
preparing himself, says Charles M. Lillis, a former GE executive who hired=
=20
Immelt in 1982.
""Starting in high school, (in) everything he did he was a leader,"" Lillis=
=20
told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""He played football. He was a student=
=20
leader. He went to Procter & Gamble after college and he did a great job in=
=20
sales. He also had the right balance of self-confidence and awareness that =
he=20
did not know everything.""
Immelt has strong marketing skills and helped create the GE slogan, ""We bri=
ng=20
good things to life,"" in his first job at GE.
Analysts and friends say the 6-foot, 4-inch Immelt possesses not only a=20
commanding physical presence but also the intellectual strength necessary t=
o=20
inspire management and workers at GE. Immelt believes that a consistent=20
approach will give the biggest pay off.=20
He's been with GE practically all of his working life, just as his father,=
=20
Joseph, before him. His father spent his 38-year career at GE working in th=
e=20
Aircraft Engine division in Cincinnati.
Immelt has a good sense of humor and the ability to present himself well to=
=20
both Wall Street and the average worker, much like Welch.
Immelt realizes that humor helps ease conversation, forge bonds and motivat=
e=20
people. He saw that as an offensive tackle for Dartmouth College's football=
=20
team in the 1970s.=20
Immelt wanted to keep football practice fun to keep his fellow players fire=
d=20
up. Immelt came up with gags, including a tongue-in-cheek award for the coa=
ch=20
of the week. He liked to loosen up the team with jokes on the sidelines and=
=20
in the huddle, according to teammates.
Despite the fun and games, his teammates could see Immelt's drive. ""When th=
e=20
rest of us were feeling our way through college, he took it to the next=20
level,"" former teammate Curt P. Oberg told Business Week.
Immelt studied just as hard as he played. He graduated cum laude with his=
=20
B.S. degree in applied mathematics from Dartmouth and an MBA from Harvard=
=20
University.
He joined GE in 1982 after a short stint with Procter & Gamble Co. as a bra=
nd=20
manager. His first job with GE was in corporate marketing. That was followe=
d=20
by sales, marketing and management positions in the company's plastics and=
=20
appliances divisions.
When Immelt took over at GE Medical Systems in 1997, one of his first actio=
ns=20
was to oversee an internal management shake-up.
""He is an extremely capable executive leader, as evidenced by his record as=
=20
CEO of GE Medical Systems,"" analyst Martin Sankey, vice president of Goldma=
n,=20
Sachs & Co. in New York told The Associated Press. ""He compiled a strong=20
record of generating growth and moving into new markets.""
GE Medical Systems has seen profit rise as demand for big-ticket medical=20
imaging and patient-monitoring gear has grown.
""Immelt clearly runs the best business at GE-GE Medical,"" Bill Fiala, an=20
analyst at Edward Jones, told Reuters. ""He's taken it international, and he=
's=20
done a fantastic job designing new products and capturing market share.""
He's a disciple and expert of Six Sigma, the quality movement that has been=
=20
made almost a religion at GE. Six Sigma is a complex, highly statistical=20
quality program that Welch wants as his legacy.
To make sure he understood the program, Immelt immersed himself in the stud=
y=20
of Six Sigma. Relying on his background in mathematics, he worked out=20
probabilities by using solid statistical research.
GE's next chief will replace an executive who has become a poster boy for=
=20
American-style capitalism. Welch's relentless focus on profit and market=20
share =01) and GE's evolution from basic manufacturing to the service secto=

This morning Rich Gardner of SSB issued a negative report on the segment and

This is the same analyst that called out stuffing last quarter.

Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a
few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to
call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy
for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until
December 7.

The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my
name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am
not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the
National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management
and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic
administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little
different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on
economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain.

Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am
carrying my computer).

CALIFORNIANS NEED MORE ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION, NOT LESS

The huge jump in electricity rates in parts of California last summer cause=

However, the ISO's price caps ensure that Californians will face future=20

""The ISO's price caps are a case of a remedy that is far worse than the=20

David W Delainey,Mariner,"Tue, 28 Nov 2000 12:34:00 -0800 (PST)","Ken, in response to your note, I am not aware of any official dialogue with 
Mr. Kase Lawal about a potential sale of Mariner or with the economics of the 
aborted IPO.  His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months 
ago.  However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are 
expected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention 
significant increases in gas and oil prices.  Our current valuations, in the 
$600M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve 
growth and current energy prices.  Our current goal, is to be able to 
demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and 
reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a 
significant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.  The 
concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a 
very poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable 
strategy to maximize the exit value).

I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points:
 a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and
 b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.

Otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to 
sell tha asset.

I hope this meets with your approval.

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a ""Core School"" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin-


Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.


            Nov.2 email text


We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.


The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a ""live
case study"" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.


You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  


We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.


The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       


The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.


I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.


Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.

I wanted to let you know that I visited Philippe Bibi last Thursday to
debrief on this loss and also to listen to a number of other points he
raised that could improve the the way we work together. Philippe was very
helpful and very direct - which I appreciate.

Some of the reasons we lost this bid is that we failed to execute the sales
process as I would expect us to. This is not typical of the way we should
now work and we have made changes to account management and service
representation.

We have made enormous progress as a Corporation over the last twelve months.
There is a lot of good news in many accounts around the world but there is
also no complacency and it concerns me a great deal when we have less than
perfect execution.

I shall be following up with Philippe and the account team to ensure we do a
great job in the future.

Peter

Charlene Jackson,Re: Nelson Steele,"Wed, 29 Nov 2000 10:04:00 -0800 (PST)","Bobbie,
We have finally been able to track down a resume for Nelson Steele.  Based 
upon his resume he is not someone we would have invited to interview for the 
Analyst Program.  We have also spoken to the Portland Office regarding the 
interview that Nelson had with them.  According to Amy Fitzpatrick, the HR 
Rep in Portland, when he interviewed he was extremely unimpressive.  
Consequently, he was not extended an offer by the Portland Office.  When they 
called to tell him such, his response was, ""that's OK because I did not want 
to work there anyway.""

I am doubtful that he will fare well in the interview process but will bring 
him in if that is what is desired.  Please let me know how you wish for us to 
proceed.  Thanks.

their April issue.  The annual technology/business issue is the magazine's 
largest and most prestigious.  The article will be both a personality profile 
and a business overview, with an emphasis on our broadband business.  The 
writer, Carol Rust, is scheduled to interview you in your office on Thursday, 
Nov. 30 from 10 a.m. to noon.

She has submitted the following questions in advance of the interview:

How did you achieve the transformation from a gas pipeline company to a 
cutting-edge energy powerhouse?  
How has EnronOnline been developed and what have the benefits been?
What aspects of the company (flexibility, for example) allow it to achieve 
success in so many varied areas?
How do you come up with new ideas?
Of all the things for an energy company to do, why offer bandwidth to content 
providers?
What are the exact mechanics of the broadband operation?
How much of the market does Enron have now, and how much does Enron want?
What did start-up of the broadband business involve?
What were the costs -- money and time?
What do you say to nay-sayers who say Enron will remain only a bit player in 
this field?
What's next?

I will bring Carol to your office at 10 a.m. and sit in on the interview to 
coordinate any follow-up questions.

Sanjay Bhatnagar,Dabhol Status,"Thu, 30 Nov 2000 10:07:00 -0800 (PST)","Jeff/Ken:

I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday 
and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3 days, 
I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very close 
friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some 
politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about 
Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at 
about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading 
newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the 
pot. 

The facts however are as follows:

1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly 
behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the 
same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also 
believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.

2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan  
(thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves 
MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will 
then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently  control 
and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already been 
discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously 
the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the 
outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with 
MOP on Monday. 

Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised  
of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already 
done Tuesday.

3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day 
waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation 
at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer - 
subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under 
any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to 
move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.

4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the 
duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current 
$35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase 
I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently with Ministry 
of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it favorably as the 
MOP is taking it up personally.

All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to 
believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the 
earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the 
current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of 
current and existing documentation.

I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has been 
scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the meantime.

Sanjay Bhatnagar,Re: Meetings with Sharad Pawar,"Thu, 30 Nov 2000 11:00:00 -0800 (PST)","Rebecca: 

These meetings that were set up with Pawar in Delhi were supposed to be 
attended by Wade but but he was unable to attend them due to the fact that he 
fell sick. No agreements have been reached because there are none that are 
contemplated. All we have done is to encourage the GOM to approach the GOI 
for reducing their own liabilities. The details you will find in the other 
memo I have already sent to you. (I picked up your email after I finished 
sending my emails).  The approach as u will notice is no different than what 
we have been following all along and I believe that  you know that already.  
If u want further clarification, I am happy to discuss this with you or if u 
want to follow a different strategy then please let me know. I am at the 
Delhi Oberoi at  91-11-4363030, room 716.

Ken had expressed to me last week that you desired to take charge immediately 
and start moving the resolution of the Dabhol issues forward. I agree that 
this will be the best way forward. Given the way things are moving, I think 
that it would be best  that you arrive in Delhi immediately over the weekend 
so that I can introduce you to the players on Monday and start transitioning 
the relationships to you and Wade. Wade will join the team in delhi as soon 
as he is able to travel. Tuesday onwards I have urgent commitments in Mumbai 
that require my presence there.

As you can appreciate, your presence in these meetings will be essential for 
you to start getting a feel for the situation on the ground and developing 
the rapport with the key players. The GOM is clearly driving the train and if 
we are to assist them its essential that we not slow them down and assist 
them in any way we can.

Steve Iyer,Your support for becoming a US citizen,"Fri, 1 Dec 2000 06:28:00 -0800 (PST)","Dear Ken:  The purpose of this note is to seek your help in becoming a 
citizen of the US.

I've been a Houston-based employee of Enron for nearly 10 years, of which 
seven were with the Dabhol project.  I obtained my green card in 1992, which 
entitled me to apply for US citizenship in 1997.  I recently went through the 
final interview and was awaiting a call to take oath.

Instead, the INS denied my application for citizenship on grounds of my 
extensive travel.  This, despite the fact that:

(1).  A disqualification can be made only if an applicant is 

- out of the country for a continuous period of six months; or
- is out of the country for more than 30 months in the sixty month period 
after the green card.  (Neither of these apply to me).

(2).  I had filed a notification to the INS immediately after getting my 
green card (in 1992) informing them that I will be travelling extensively on 
business.  Filing this notification allows me to travel without the 
restrictions mentioned above.

Ken, I need your help on two fronts:

(1).  Support in filing an appeal to the INS.  This will cost an outside 
counsel between $1500-$3000.

(2).  Request my US Representative Mr.DeLay to send the attached letter to 
the local INS administrator.

I believe this will clear the way for my becoming a citizen of the US, to 
which I eagerly look forward.

Editorial - TEACHING AN OLD INDUSTRY NEW TRICKS VIA THE INTERNET

The concept of =01&E-learning=018 is basically an old idea that has come ba=
ck into
vogue with the never-ending possibilities offered by the World Wide Web.
From training employees to collaborating and sharing information with
business partners and suppliers, today=01,s businesses are utilizing web
technology to broaden their share of the market.

Uday Om Pabrai calls E-learning the Internet=01,s =01&next killer applicati=
on.=018
Pabrai is a longtime web-watcher, having founded Net Guru Technologies in
1992, and having created the first webmaster certification
standard-Certified Internet Webmaster. He is now chairman of the AIP
Certification and Accreditation Council.

The energy industry, though cautious about utilizing the web, is scrambling
to take advantage of this next big thing.  Recently, several top companies
have taken the plunge to hire Internet professionals to develop their own
virtual training programs.

Equiva Services LLC, a joint venture company formed by Texaco Inc., Shell
Oil Company and Saudi Refining, Inc, ABB Vetco Gray, and Columbia Gulf
Transmission Company, have all recently jumped on the e-learning bandwagon.
All three companies have created web-based platforms or e-commerce hubs tha=
t
enable employees to quickly and conveniently get necessary training from
pre-selected suppliers.

=01&This type of innovative application of information technology will help=
 us
to work smarter and faster for our internal clients,=018 said Mari Duarte,
senior human resources generalist for ABB Vetco Gray.  =01&We expect to low=
er
costs and improve efficiency by reducing the time of administrative
transactions related to registration and by improving reporting of
information related to training activities to management.=018

For the energy industry, E-learning can involve both the automation of
training management systems as well as the transmission and delivery of
learning to individuals through use of the Internet.  Through this
technology, training information previously available through classroom
instruction can be delivered directly to employees=01, desktops in differen=
t
forms, ranging from basic presentation-style courses to highly interactive
courses with digitized video transmissions and on-line discussions.

=01&E-learning can encompass training employees and it can be used to share
important knowledge across the organization and with outside business
partners,=018 said Dennis McMullin, energy industry consultant at Proxicom,=
 a
leading Internet consulting firm in Houston, Texas.  McMullin says that mor=
e
companies are increasing the amount of training they offer online to help
employees stay current on market trends and personal skills.  =01&There can=
 be
a significant cost savings involved in using technology for learning, but a
company=01,s success ultimately depends on how effectively it can bring the
technology into the organization and how well they use it.=018

E-learning technology can also ease the administrative burden on an
organization=01,s human resources department and lower the per-unit cost of
training employees.  Additionally, management has the ability to better
analyze training needs and how to best deploy the information.  =01&Web-bas=
ed
training is extremely flexible and offers employees convenience in
scheduling courses when they need and want them,=018 said McMullin.  =01&It=
 also
allows them the opportunity to go back and revisit course material if the
need a refresher or a resource.  It is a self-teaching method that lets
individuals learn at their own pace and based on their own needs.""

Internet companies such as VerticalNet, Inc. in Horsham, PA, offer companie=
s
the ability to manage training programs through an Internet interface that
directly links the company with training suppliers.  Taken one stop further=
,
VerticalNet=01,s =01&Training Intelligence Portals=018 enable companies to =
centralize
their personnel training programs and literally outsource administration an=
d
other back-office transactions such as invoice management, utilization
reporting, course evaluation and quality assurance.

According to Walter Rogers, VerticalNet=01,s eBusiness training services se=
nior
director and general manager, the energy industry is becoming more
aggressive in moving from office administration and classroom learning to
web-based technology for training.  =01&We=01,re seeing a lot more demand f=
rom the
energy sector for e-learning technology,=018 said Rogers, whose firm is
currently working with several large energy companies.  =01&We=01,ve found =
that
the energy industry doesn=01,t typically lead the way in the use of technol=
ogy.
It tends to want to see it working and proven in other areas before they tr=
y
it.  But now they are getting more involved.  Since the industry is driven
to reduce operating costs, it finds this technology to be very cost
effective.=018

In addition to hiring Internet experts to develop and manage a training
site, Dennis McMullin points out that there is a large variety of existing
training opportunities for on-line learning.  =01&Most of the technology
companies offer on-line training for technical products, while numerous web
sites offer free information and opportunities for e-learning,=018 he said.

In the end, however, McMullin believes that acceptance of the Internet is
more than a technological issue for many companies, rather it requires a
cultural adjustment.  =01&It really is an issue of adjusting the company
culture to accept and benefit from Internet technology.  It requires
companies to be more open and less fearful of sharing information.  Energy
companies could really benefit from effective use of the Internet if they
use it as a median to share more knowledge throughout their organizations
and with suppliers.=018

Spare plant parts become manageable with Sparesfinder.com

ideas about India.

opportunites that await me once I graduate in May of 2001. I have spent some
time looking at your website and I am very intersted in Enron as a possible

I would love to hear from you as to your thoughts on my resume and a

World

Here is the concept:

Today's Board of Directors are confronted by unprecedented complex issues
(globalization, optimizing board size for responsiveness, CEO
disintermediation, diversity, option repricing, CEO evaluation, board member

removal, increasing importance of audit committee, diverse shareholder time
horizons (for whom do we manage?)

These Board issues confront both large established companies as well as
emerging growth companies.  Spencer Stuart would like to host a provocative
examination of  issues common to Boards of today as a panel delves into some

of the issues common to boards at both ends of the spectrum.

Spencer Stuart is the market dominator in Board of Directors work.  Tom Neff

and Julie Daum, leaders of SpencerStuart's global board practice, will lead
a
lively discussion with our distinguished panel.

Target                   CEO's and Board Members
Audience:

Format:                 Invitation Only

Anticipated
Audience:               25-30

Time and Place:      8 am, Omni Hotel
    Houston, TX

We feel that it would be very powerful (and we would be most appreciative)
to
have Ken and Mark Lay on the panel addressing issues confronting boards of
today, representing their respective backgrounds and experiences of serving
on boards.

I'd be happy to go over this in greater detail.  Call me at (713) 225-1621.

Please let me know as soon as possible if this date works with your
calendar.

BROWN_MARY_JO@LILLY.COM,Transactions in Lilly Stock,"Mon, 4 Dec 2000 09:10:00 -0800 (PST)","This is a reminder of your ongoing obligation to report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these ""black-outs"" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of ""inside
   information"" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in November, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

with two Latin American clients.  Expect to close one or both transactions by 
year end.  Initiated discussions with EBS to review technology for EBS 
clients.
Cynet - Expect to close sale of fax broadcast business by December 15, but 
will have to finance $3.5 mm of $7.0 mm purchase price.  We are evaluating 
alternative structures to address collateral issues and pay down a portion of 
our existing preferred position.
Illusions Screen Printing - Moore Business Systems (an Enron Vendor) is very 
late on a significant receivable for the company.  We are working with Enron 
personel to address the issue.
American Communication Services - Increasing SWB agency business and 
developing prime contractor relationship with SWB.
Treasury Connect - The company is having limited success in fund raising.  
Currently the company is negotiating with TH Lee, Softbank and Reuters for 
investments.  Paribas has committed to a private label portal transaction and 
Deutsche Bank is reviewing a proposal.  With no new revenues, the company 
will run out of cash at the end of January.  If currently anticipated 
consulting and private label transactions are completed, the company should 
be able to operate through March without additional financing.
Cabo's - Indicated that their liquor license had not been issued yet because 
of delays caused by a background review of one of the limited partners.  
Expect to have this addressed shortly.

New Transactions
Urban Financial - Expect closing December 15.  Our client negotiated a 
significant reduction in the purchase price, in large part, because of an 
equity funding shortfall.  Capital ratios for the bank will remain strong and 
the new bank has already received indications of commitments from State of 
Connecticut agencies.
Custom Feeds - Omni Bank is preparing their documents.  All other documents 
have been drafted and are being reviewed.

Julie Cobb,Chairman's Award,"Tue, 5 Dec 2000 01:53:00 -0800 (PST)","Dear Mr.s Lay and Skilling

Thank you; I just received my t-shirt and letter regarding the Chairman's 
award nomination.  I was really flattered to have received that mention.  The 
traits sought by the Chairman's award are those I would really like to 
exemplify; respect, communication, integrity, and excellence.  To even have 
been considered worthy is exciting and humbling.  I know that truly most 
people at Enron hope to display these values, and for you to have designed an 
award to recognize them is really inspiring.

In short, it meant a lot to me, to have been mentioned for the Chairman's 
award within a company of which I am so proud.  I know it will mean a great 
deal to the person I will seek to nominate, when I next have the opportunity.

Thank you.
Sincerely,
Julia Cobb

> joining our organization.  He and his team are doing a great job, and
> together we will further our efforts to become the leader throughout the
> world in satisfying our customers.
>
> Most of all, I am extremely pleased and encouraged because I believe these

> already reported a number of major wins as a result of the joint efforts
> by our Sales and Services teams.  There is an air of excitement and
> anticipation about Compaq's momentum - I see it in the emails from many of
> you and as I meet with our teams and customers around the world.  You're a
> remarkable team and, as Michael puts it, let's keep the pedal to the metal
> and keep the momentum strong as we work to successfully close 2000!
>
> Speaking of my travels...
> This month I visited Johannesburg, South Africa, Dubai within the United
> Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.  All of these countries are part of
> EMEA's Business Development Group (BDG), which is responsible for
> developing Compaq business in 98 countries. The group is focused on both
> developed and emerging markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and
> Africa. Over the past six years, BDG has grown its revenue more than
> 10-fold.
>
> In South Africa I visited Vodacom, which with 4 million subscribers, is
> Africa's largest mobile phone network operator.  The company has just
> upgraded its billing systems to handle further expansion, and to date is
> one of the world's largest Wildfire installations with some 21 AlphaServer
> GS systems.  I also spent time with the management of Mobile Telephone
> Networks (MTN), South Africa's #2 cellphone operator and another big
> Wildfire customer.  In fact, we just got word that they've placed a $10M
> order for four GS320 AlphaServer systems and storage.
>
> One of my more interesting activities while there was learning more about
> Ikageng, a Compaq-led initiative to bring the benefits of the information
> age to the rural communities of Africa.  Ikageng brings together the
> provision of safe drinking water, affordable healthcare, distance
> learning, improved subsistence farming techniques and Internet access.
> All of this is co-funded by a community bank, together with Compaq,
> Johnnic, a South African media and information group, and the active
> participation of the World Bank.  A real example of Inspiration Technology
> at work!
>
> My visit to the United Arab Emirates included a dinner with our top 30
> customers from across the region, a VIP lunch with our top partners, as
> well as meetings with employees in the region.  I also attended Gitex, the
> region's largest IT exhibition, and met with press at that event to convey
> Compaq's commitment to the UAE.  I was also privileged to have a personal
> meeting with His Highness Sheik Mohamad bin Rashid al Maktoum, Crown
> Prince of Dubai and the Minister of Defense.  These meetings were around
> the official opening of Dubai Internet City, an area of Dubai dedicated to
> making the city the ""Silicon Valley""  of the Middle East.
>
> I spent a very interesting day at Aramco in Saudi Arabia, our largest
> account in the UAE. We are the ProLiant standard in this very large energy
> company and we have a great opportnuity to build a strong partnership
> across many additional solutions including high performance technical
> computing, ZLE applications and enterprise storage, in addition to
> recapturing client business from the competition
>
> Some of our largest wins this month

> Planning for Innovate Forum 2001 under way
> Compaq's premier event for its global and large account customers -
> Innovate Forum 2001 - is set for May 23-24 at the George R. Brown
> Convention Center in Houston.  The hand-picked guest list will include
> some 4,000-5,000 senior-level technical and business executives, including

> Cross Border Office files first lawsuit
> The Cross Border Office has been created to prevent unauthorized movement
> of Compaq products by dealers and gray market brokers in order to protect
> profit margins and ultimately, customer satisfaction.  The Cross Border
> team provides gray market awareness training to all sales personnel, mail
> and phone hotline access to report gray market activity, works jointly
> with regional sales, services, business unit and channel teams to create
> policy and procedures to reduce gray market activity and, working with the
> Law department, to bring legal action against gray market brokers if
> warranted.
>
> As a result of these efforts, Compaq has filed its first lawsuit against
> two Canadian technology consulting firms for breach of contract and fraud.
> The suit, which seeks compensatory damages of more than $17 million,
> claims the consulting firms fraudulently represented to Compaq that they
> had a contract with the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal
> Aviation Administration to supply a large number of computers and related
> equipment to U.S. airports. This lawsuit hit many national publications
> and sends a message to the worldwide gray market community that Compaq
> will take actions to protect its authorized resellers, product quality and
> our customers.

> Key Channel Partner programs rolling out
> Early this year the Tigerbite project was established to redefine and
> simplify Compaq's model with our channel partners.  A key element of the
> model is worldwide programs that provide profitable growth opportunities
> for Compaq and its partners.  Two such programs - Internet List Pricing
> (ILP) and the Compaq Agent Program - are currently being implemented by
> the regions.
>
> Worldwide implementation of ILP is a top priority for the company.
> Creating and publishing (where needed) competitive List Prices is
> absolutely essential to establishing a more consistent, worldwide pricing
> model for both our customers and partners. By the end of this month ILP
> will have been implemented in North America, Latin America, Japan and
> Greater China, with pilot programs in Singapore and Malaysia.  EMEA and
> the remaining Asia Pacific countries are expected to complete the rollout
> by January 1, 2001.
>
> The Compaq Agent Program, which allows partners to earn commissions when
> they refer customers to purchase products/services directly from us,
> currently has been implemented in the U.S., Latin America (14 countries)
> and CKK.  This month, APD is implementing pilot programs in Singapore and
> Malaysia, and plans to roll out the program in seven additional countries
> in the first quarter.  EMEA held an Agent Program Summit this month with
> 10 countries to assess and develop their 2001 rollout plans which include
> adding Enterprise-class products to their program next year.
>
> News from the Compaq Alliances team
> *      Compaq regained the #1 platform partner position with SAP with 33%
> market share over all platforms (NT, UNIX with R/3, and mySAP.com). IBM is
> 2nd in line with 23% share. In North America alone, our overall SAP share
> increased from 25% to 32% in the third quarter.  As an aside, SAP's entire
> executive board and senior executive staff use our iPAQ Pocket PCs.
> Rollout of the product to SAP Sales and Marketing is also in progress -- a
> very visible endorsement of Compaq's leadership in Internet access as it
> applies to enterprise applications.
> * Cable & Wireless CEO and executive visit to Marlboro in October
> included CEO Graham Wallace and 56 top C&W executives. C&W new ASP
> 'a-Services' UK launch on October 31 followed the successful U.S. launch
> in late September.
> * Compaq secured the notebook business with CGE&Y UK for their
> internal use.  Toshiba had been the incumbent for 5 years.  CGE&Y is

                Lilly and Generex Sign Agreement To Develop

                          Buccal Form of Insulin



Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Generex Biotechnology Corporation

(NASDAQ: GNBT) today announced that they have signed an agreement to

develop a buccal formulation of insulin that is administered as a fine

spray into the oral cavity using Generex proprietary technology.



Under the terms of the agreement, Generex will receive certain initial fees

and milestone payments.  Generex will also receive royalty payments based

on product sales.  In exchange, Lilly will receive exclusive worldwide

rights to products resulting from the collaboration.  Lilly will be

responsible for conducting clinical trials, securing regulatory approvals

and marketing on a worldwide basis.  Clinical trials of the first product

candidate are under way in North America and Europe.  Lilly will also have

the option to develop a number of additional products depending on the

success of the initial product.



""We look forward to working with Generex, whose buccal spray delivery

technology potentially represents a novel approach to drug delivery,"" said

James A. Harper, president, diabetes and growth disorders products for

Lilly. ""A buccal spray formulation of insulin could provide an attractive

alternative for people with diabetes.""



""The opportunity to partner with Lilly, the global leader in insulins, to

develop the world's first marketed buccal insulin spray represents very

good news for millions of patients with diabetes throughout the world,""

said Anna Gluskin, chief executive officer of Generex. ""We are pleased that

Lilly has recognized the potential of buccal delivery of insulin and

Generex's RapidMist? technology for systemic delivery of proteins, peptides

and other large molecule drugs.""



Today, worldwide costs for treating diabetes and its complications are

estimated to exceed $200 billion annually.  It is also estimated that, over

the next decade, the number of people with this disease will more than

double.  Lilly has been a leader in diabetes care for more than 75 years.

The company continues to aggressively pursue the goal of being a complete

diabetes care company and intends to provide innovative products to treat

all types and stages of diabetes.



Generex is engaged in the research and development of drug delivery systems

and technologies. To date, it has focused on developing a platform

technology for the buccal delivery (absorption through the inner cheek

walls) of large molecule drugs which, historically, have been administered

only by injection. Additional information about Generex can be found at

www.generex.com.



Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing

portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest

research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with

eminent scientific organizations. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind.,

Lilly provides answers ? through medicines and information ? for some of

the world's most urgent medical needs.



Certain statements set forth above may constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Although Generex and Lilly believe that such statements are
based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of their knowledge of
their business and operations, there can be no assurance that: (i) Lilly or
Generex will not terminate the collaboration, (ii) that any products will
be developed, manufactured or commercialized successfully, or (iii) that
significant funding will be received by Generex as a result of this
collaboration.

Each company's business is subject to significant risks and there can be no

results of their operations will not differ materially from expectations.

Dear Mr. Lay,

You might recall very kindly hosting a dinner at The Travellers Club in
London for the first energy retreat that we did with Reinhold Heus and Ralph
Hodge. We were very sorry to have missed you this year though we very much
understand that campaigning for the elections was an absolute priority.

I was very pleased to hear that you had tentatively agreed to be able to
make the 25th May free for next years retreat. This years theme, after a
great del of research is set to focus on e commerce and the new economy and
will look at the inter relationship between energy, communication and
investment. I therefore thought that it would be particularly appropriate
given the outstanding work that you are doing in this area. I am sure that
you will feel that the participants are of great interest and I hope that it
will be a real learning experience for both the state companies and the
international energy companies.

As before the group will be limited to 60 top-level executives from
multinationals, independents and state companies and we would aim that some
of the main issues to be covered include:
* Corporate renewal - develop and maintain a competitive edge
* Diversification in the energy industry: into telecommunications,
power, water, e-commerce, trading, auto  - energy in the new economy
* E - Commerce
* Breakthrough in new technologies

I do hope that you are able to confirm your keynote attendance and look
forward to hearing from you.

I also thought that you might be interested in the attached outlining the
governments with which we work.
I very much look forward to hearing from you. .

In the meantime I remain,

Yours sincerely,

First - congratulations on your year 2000 to date. From what I have
researched, Enron is an incredible organization of products, services and
people.

I represent MobileStar - the worlds largest public Wireless Lan company.
Based in Dallas, and private at this time - we have built and will continue
to build a WIFI IEEE 802.11b lan network in public places such as hotels,
airports, airline clubs and retail/coffee house type places where mobile
users go, eat, move, meet and sleep.  You will find us today in many
Marriotts, Hiltons, Sheratons and American Airline Admiral club rooms-
offering unteathered T-1 speed connectivity to a company lan or the
internet.

We are soon to launch Hong Kong Int Airport and the London airports as well.
We also have a confidential network partner/s in the works to be announced
in the next 30 days that will take our public network to over 5000 locations
in the next 2 years. You will be interested I assure you.

I feel that not only is MobileStar a service that could benefit your mobile
global staff that travels both domestically, locally and internationally,
but also a partner tie in terms of content delivery, possible backbone
partnerships and video/Blockbuster delivery to a MobileStar subscribers
handheld, Ipaq computer or laptop.

I would very much like the opportunity to meet with both your IT team whom
investigates wireless applications and services for your personnel as well
as a member of your Broadband Development team.

Also - I will offer you a FREE trial subscription to our network for  your
travels.

I thank you for your time.

PS - We are heading into Series C funding..........

"""Shannon Callan"" <CALLAS@tcwgroup.com>",Visit to Enron,"Tue, 5 Dec 2000 02:20:00 -0800 (PST)","Dear Ken,

I am conducting a review of Enron for TCW's equity portfolios.  You may 
recall that we have spoken several times when you visited TCW for the Board 
of Directors meetings.  Previously I worked in TCW's Latin America investment 
department and have followed Enron's investments in Latin America.  I am now 
working as an analyst for TCW's equity research department.   With the 
encouragement of Robert Day and Leigh Crawford, whom you met with recently in 
Phoenix, I am considering making a recommendation for the purchase of Enron 
stock.

I am writing to you to solicit your help in setting up a visit to Enron for 
Leigh Crawford and myself.  We are interested in meeting with you, Clifford 
Baxter, Jeffrey Skilling, Andrew Fastow, Mark Koenig, Richard Buy and any 
other individuals you believe would be helpful in our understanding your 
business.  We would also welcome the opportunity to tour Enron's facilities.

The date of the visit can be chosen for the convenience of you and the other 
managers.  The week of December 18th and the early weeks of January are 
particularly convenient for us.

Thank you very much for your help and I look forward to learning more about 
Enron.

Jackie Henry,Thank You!,"Tue, 5 Dec 2000 06:23:00 -0800 (PST)","For years I followed the positive contributions ENRON made to the community 
and its staff.  I always dreamed of working for a company that truly cared.  
My prayers were answered.  I am proud to be a part of this team and look 
forward to many years of prosperity and success.  After working for a private 
practice for 10 years and being told that the corporate work environment was 
impersonal, I have seen ENRON promote and display respect, integrity, 
communication and excellence.  If someone gives respect, the person receiving 
it might build up their self-esteem and in return respect others.  Being 
honest gains trust and sometimes trust can be more valuable than money.  
Without communication, walls are built and eventually tumble down hurting 
everyone/everything surrounding them.  I really applaud your vision on 
communication.  Good communication is the main ingredient in every view of 
life.  Keep up the good work.  Striving for excellence encourages people to 
work hard, utilize their creative minds, explore new areas, and learn to 
adjust to change.  

Thank you again for allowing me to be a part of such a GREAT team.    ","[('I', 5), ('communication', 4), ('years', 3)]"

of impending doom, Mr. Davidow has taken to reminding all who will listen,
""There was a tulip business even after the tulip mania."" Which prompted me to
dig out my copy of Mike Dash's Tulipomania -- subtitled, ""The Story of the
World's Most Coveted Flower & The Extraordinary Passions It Aroused.""
    Davidow is indeed right, and in the post-bubble history of the tulip
business may lurk some clues as to the history of the dot.coms, many of which
have been liquidated, while others have seen their values fall by as much as
90%.
    After the bubble burst, the trade in bulbs did not disappear. Prices
fell, but in a few years ""the trade regain[ed] some sort of equilibrium. The
speculators had gone, but there was still a market for the flower."" But at
far lower prices, with the specialty bulbs doing better than the garden
variety tulip. And it is not to stretch the analogy between tulip-growing and
the dot.com business to cite Dash's observation that ""most of the new and
inexperienced growers who had been attracted by the prospect of rich profits
gave up the business or were driven out.""
    Eventually, bulb growers learned how to turn a profit again. They
converted their business from a seasonal one to one that could produce all
year 'round -- something e-tailers have still to learn. They learned how to
destroy the viruses that periodically destroyed their businesses -- something
Microsoft et al. have still to learn. They learned how to compete with other
varieties of flower -- just as e-tailers have been learning how to click with
bricks-and-mortar retailers.
    In short, although the past is not necessarily prologue, history suggests
that there indeed life after a bubble bursts. For one thing, investors have
short memories: the tulipomania was followed by a spurt in the prices of
hyacinths in the eighteenth century, and by one in dahlias in 1838. Indeed,
as recently as 1985 prices of the red spider lily soared in China, reaching
$50,000 for the most coveted varieties, ""an amount that puts even the sums
paid at the height of the Dutch tulip craze to shame"", according to Dash.
    More important, the bursting of a bubble separates the wheat from the
chaff. The fact that the business graveyard is overflowing with the corpses
of dot.coms tells us less about the future role of the internet in our
economic lives than it does about the propensity of some to irrational
exuberance. It should come as no surprise that companies that not only failed
to earn any money as their customer lists swelled, but touted their mounting
losses as proof of their success in growing their businesses, should
eventually fall from investor favour.
    Nor should it be surprising that inexperienced entrepreneurs, whose sole
lasting contribution to American life has been the destruction of the
business suit, have discovered that there is more to running a successful
business than attracting the adulation of equally young and casually clad
reporters for trade magazines.
    Finally, it should not surprise us that the accumulation of data in this
era of the so-called ""new economy"" has led to a more sober appraisal of the
contribution of new technologies to the ability of the American economy to
grow without triggering significant inflation. We now know that the massive
investment in new technologies has increased the rate of growth in
productivity, and that the economy's speed limit has been raised to something
closer to 4% than to its old limit of about half that. That's not as
revolutionary as some of the more strident ""new economy"" advocates have been
claiming, but it is enough to make an unemployment rate of only 4%
sustainable in the long run without setting off a round of wage-price
inflation.
    What we have, then, is what might be called the residue of the dot.com
collapse -- a new way of doing business, greater productivity in important
sectors of the economy, lower transactions costs as buyers and sellers come
together without the intervention of middlemen, new exchanges in which
everything from electricity to broadband capacity can be traded efficiently,
and an increase in consumer power to resist price increases.
    These are permanent changes. The pace at which they are introduced and
become entrenched will, of course, be affected by the increased volatility of
share prices. Such volatility, after all, makes investment in shares somewhat
riskier, which is another way of saying that the price that entrepreneurs
will have to pay for capital to reward investors for taking these higher
risks will rise -- indeed, has already risen. But the improvements in
productivity and efficiency will not be reversed, even if the economy slows
significantly, as it now is deemed likely to do.
    Perhaps most important of all of our new knowledge is our increased
understanding of the use of the policy tools available to cope with economic
downturns. The market soared last week after Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan suggested that he was considering lowering interest rates, and the
Florida courts increased the likelihood that George W. Bush rather than the
more antibusiness Al Gore would move into the White House when the lease of
Bill and Hillary Clinton expires next month.
    Investors know that Greenspan can stimulate the economy by lowering
interest rates, which are high in real terms. After all, as discussed
elsewhere in these pages, he reversed a far more serious stock market plunge
in 1997 by easing monetary policy. Investors know, too, that the Bush team
aims to ease fiscal policy by pushing a tax cut through congress. That
combination of looser monetary and fiscal policies can go a long way towards
preventing this slowdown from becoming a recession.

water in fact is a scarce resource, either due to the availability or

different risk/reward relationships per each tier.  Just a thought.

Vera Jones,Company Historian,"Wed, 6 Dec 2000 05:21:00 -0800 (PST)","Ken,

In my pre-Enron life, I taught history (years and years ago).  

Recently, while culling files in preparation for moving from EB to 3AC,  I 
came across a pamphlet about the origins of the Transwestern Pipeline Company 
and found it very interesting - for the second or third time.

In particular, I am impressed by the vision these pioneers had.  My concern 
is that our Enron preserve some record of those early people and days of the 
entities that make up the bigger Enron.  They were awesome.

In another pre-Enron segment of my life, I worked for a rare and out-of-print 
book dealer.  One of the collections we worked hard to accumulate and then to 
sell as a collection was a group of business histories.  The collection was 
snapped up the first month we put it on the market.  Great business stories 
go on and on being researched by and inspiring new generations of 
entrepreneurs.

Not having practiced my craft as historian for many years, I am no longer 
familiar with the important names in historical writing (except for popular 
historians such as Stephen Ambrose).  If Enron doesn't already have a 
historian, we need an established writer of substantial stature - someone 
whose produced work would reach a lot of people.  

Maybe someone from the Rice University staff could point the way?  Or, maybe 
even someone from Rice has the qualities needed to produce an exciting 
history of Enron.

Because ours is such a great story, I would like to see a project such as 
this pursued.  I would like to know what you think about this suggestion.

Thanks for letting me send this your way.

Clients and friends:

    Nonprofit organizations that maintain websites will want to know that the
IRS is considering regulating nonprofit Web speech.  Public comments are
being sought by the IRS on these proposed new rules for nonprofits.


    The Internal Revenue Service has released ""Announcement 2000-84""
soliciting public comment on possible new regulations for charities, think
tanks and educational organizations.


    Among the questions the IRS is addressing in its review of exempt

organization's speech on their Internet sites is:


""Does providing a hyperlink on a charitable organization's website to

another organization that engages in political campaign intervention result

in per se prohibited political intervention?""


""To what extent are statements made by subscribers to a forum, such as a

listserv or newsgroup, attributable to an exempt organization that

maintains the forum?""


""Does a website constitute a single publication or communication? If not,

how should it be separated into distinct publications or communications?""


House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, has issued a statement

condemning the IRS' consideration of new regulations for the Internet.


""The IRS has no business getting involved in whether a think thank has

links on its website, or how often a charity's site is updated,"" he said.

""The idea of turning the tax man into a Net cop would have a chilling

effect on free speech on the Internet. I'm glad the agency has not taken

any regulatory action yet. But let's be clear about this. We will be

watching what they do, and we will not tolerate any backdoor attempt to

regulate the Internet.""


The public comment period on this issue will close Feb. 13, 2001, according

to the IRS announcement. Comments are to be directed to Judith E. Kindell,

the principal author of the announcement, at the IRS, 1111 Constitution

Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20224.

We hope you find this information of interest.  As always, if we can answer
any questions, please contact us.

areas for development over the next six years.

-Review the present environmental standards (NOM's). Make changes to
increase the compliance of micro, small and mid-sized companies.

-Study ways the private sector can participate in the development of
infrastructure to treat and dispose of industrial waste. Implement programs
to facilitate this.

-Launch special programs for large private consumers of potable water to
encourage the use of recycled water.

-Increase federal expenditures on environmental infrastructure along the
Mexico -U.S. border.


2. Implications for U.S. companies: U.S. manufacturers of equipment and
providers of environmental services should be able to increase their market
share during the next six years because of the priorities mentioned above.

Ken and Jeff,

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a ""Core School"" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin

Kevin-


Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.


            Nov.2 email text


We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.


The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a ""live
case study"" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.


You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  


We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.


The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       


The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.


I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.


Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.


Dick

"""Walker, Bruce J."" <Walker@missouri.edu>",Letter from Roger Vasey,"Tue, 12 Dec 2000 03:38:00 -0800 (PST)","Ken,

Soon you will receive (or perhaps have just received) a letter from a fellow
MU alumnus, Roger Vasey.  In the letter, Roger outlines a business
opportunity that he believes has a potential synergy with Enron.

While I am not familiar with this business opportunity, I am very familiar
with Roger.  He is now semi-retired following a very successful business
career.  He remains a special advisor to the chairman of Merrill Lynch &
Co., Inc., in New York.  Previously, he was executive VP and global director
of all debt markets underwriting, sales, and trading for the firm.

Since the early 1990s, Roger has been actively involved with MU,
specifically with the College of Business.  He has served as chair of both
the Strategic Development Board and the Davenport Society.  Roger also was a
member of the steering committee for the college's very successful capital
campaign.  I hold him in the highest regard and feel fortunate that he, like
you, has chosen to contribute to his undergraduate alma mater in various
significant ways.

I hope you will consider the opportunity described in Roger's letter.  I
know he must think it has a great deal of potential if he decided to present
it to you.

Finally, thanks very much for your holiday card and the donation
opportunity, which benefitted Boys & Girls Club of Columbia in my case.
Season's greetings,

Bruce Walker","[('Roger', 6), ('I', 5), ('opportunity', 4)]"

We are getting tremendous recruitment-advertising insertions into the 2001 IT 
Career Guide in the ""Employment Review"" banner feature within the ""USA Today"" 
Year in Review issue December 29, 30 & 31.

Many organizations are looking to get in front of the right candidates before 
the January 14 and 21 ""hiring rush"" that takes place in the Sunday 
newspapers' unemployment sections.

Consider this:

* Most candidates make the decision to seek new employment during the holiday 
season.

* Historically, ""Year In Review"" issues have broader readership and a longer 
shelf life.

* The December 29th weekend looks to be one of the heaviest travel periods of 
the year.

* The January 14 and 21 Sunday newspapers' unemployment sections will be the 
largest sections of the year - will your recruitment ad be seen?

* ""USA TODAY"" is the No. 1 read daily newspaper among IT professionals - 
reaching more than 4,600,000 active and passive IT candidates.

The ""2001 IT Career Guide"" will feature editorial on ""In-Demand Careers and 
Hot Industries"" for 2001 and a bannered recruitment-advertising section.

Reach candidates in your area with any one of the 25 advertising print 
markets within the United States.

""Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy...""

Institute, the non-partisan, public policy research organization

current research publications, events and media programs.

IN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE:
1. Pentagon ""Shocked"" to Find Rivers Dammed with Pork
2. The Environmental Propaganda Agency
3. William Lloyd Garrison, Antislavery Crusader

-------------------------------------------------------------

PENTAGON ""SHOCKED"" TO FIND RIVERS DAMMED WITH PORK

Captain Louis Renault -- Claude Raines's cheerfully duplicitous character in 
the 1942 film classic ""Casablanca"" -- asserted glibly that he was ""shocked, 
shocked"" to learn that gambling was taking place at Rick's Cafe. Moments 
later he was only too happy to collect his gambling earnings for the night.

All this is by way of preamble to a new Pentagon investigation of fraud in 
military construction. The investigation concluded that three senior Army 
Corps of Engineers officials had, just as one whistle-blowing Corps economist 
had claimed, engaged in a deceitful campaign to justify what the Washington 
Post called ""a billion-dollar construction binge on the Mississippi and 
Illinois rivers.""

""The [Pentagon] investigators concluded that the agency's aggressive efforts 
to expand its budget and missions, as well as its eagerness to please its 
corporate customers and congressional patrons, have helped 'create an 
atmosphere where objectivity in its analyses was placed in jeopardy,'"" the 
Post reports.

""Even the agency's retired chief economist told them that Corps studies were 
often 'corrupt,' and that several Corps employees cited 'immense pressure' to 
green-light questionable projects.""

Bureaucratic boondoggles of such magnitude are certainly newsworthy. But they 
are hardly news. Just as the Soviets derided the failures of previous Five 
Year Plans (only to implement new, equally flawed versions), so it seems that 
every few years the Pentagon uncovers massive corruption and waste in its own 
centrally planned fiefdom -- only to present a new Plan that operates under 
the same bad incentives that encouraged prior malfeasance.

With corruption and waste seemingly ""taken care of,"" the worst pork-barrel 
spenders in Congress and the military are then let off the hook, only to 
enjoy -- like Casablanca's Renault and Rick -- an amicable toast to the 
beginnings of a beautiful new friendship.

-------------------------------------------------------------

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROPAGANDA AGENCY

Will the neck-to-neck presidential race help reduce -- or intensify -- 
pressure for the next president of the United States to score points with 
statist environmental activists?

Except on a few controversial issues, a strong case can be made that the 
forty-third President of the United States will wish to portray himself as a 
close friend of ""the environment."" President George W. Bush, for example, 
would face strong pressure to show that he is ""bipartisan"" in his approach to 
environmental protection; whereas President Al Gore would likely attempt to 
win back those who supported Nader and the Greens.

All the more reason, then, to call attention to the failures of the current 
approach to environmental protection -- especially those emanating from the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or, as economist Craig Marxsen terms 
it, the Environmental Propaganda Agency.

The EPA sometimes employs the language of cost-benefit analysis to illustrate 
its seemingly tremendous success, but it is known to employ it in a highly 
misleading manner. The EPA claimed, for example, that its Clean Air Act 
programs produced, from 1970 to 1990, $22.2 trillion dollars in health 
benefits at a cost of only $523 billion. But, reports Marxsen in THE 
INDEPENDENT REVIEW, ""[The EPA's] study actually represents a milestone in 
bureaucratic propaganda. Like junk science in the courtroom, the study 
seemingly attempts to obtain the largest possible benefit figure rather than 
to come as close as possible to the truth.""

In conclusion, writes Marxsen, ""Without the illusory benefit of all the lives 
saved, the actual benefits of the Clean Air Act were very modest and probably 
could have been achieved nearly as well with far less sacrifice. The Clean 
Air Act and its amendments force the EPA to mandate reduction of air 
pollution to levels that would have no adverse health effects on even the 
most sensitive person in the population. The EPA relentlessly presses forward 
in its absurd quest, like a madman setting fire to his house in an insane 
determination to eliminate the last of the insects infesting it.""

WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, Antislavery Crusader

""I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this 
subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write with moderation.... I 
will not equivocate -- I will not excuse -- I will not retreat a single inch 
-- and I will be heard.""
     -- William Lloyd Garrison, THE LIBERATOR, January 1, 1831

December 12 marks the 195th anniversary of the birth of William Lloyd 
Garrison, a leading figure in the American abolitionist movement. As the late 
historian Henry Mayer explained in his National Book Award-Finalist 
biography, ALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery:

""William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879) is an authentic American hero who, with a 
Biblical prophet's power and a propagandist's skill, forced the nation to 
confront the most crucial moral issue in its history. For thirty-five years 
he edited and published a weekly newspaper in Boston, THE LIBERATOR, which 
remains today a sterling and unrivaled example of personal journalism in the 
service of civic idealism.

""Although Garrison -- a self-made man with a scanty formal education -- 
considered himself 'a New England mechanic' and lived outside the precincts 
of the American intelligentsia, he nonetheless did the hard intellectual work 
of challenging orthodoxy, questioning public policy, and offering a luminous 
vision of a society transformed. He inspired two generations of activists -- 
female and male, black and white -- and together they built a social movement 
which, like the civil rights movement of our own day, was a collaboration of 
ordinary people, stirred by injustice and committed to each other, who 
achieved a social change that conventional wisdom first condemned as wrong 
and then ridiculed as impossible.""

Indeed, without Garrison's inflammatory but compelling writing, speaking and 
organizing, there might have been no effective American anti-slavery movement 
at all.

For more on William Lloyd Garrison, read historian Henry Mayer's talk from 
the Independent Policy Forum, ""The Civil War: Liberty and American Leviathan"" 
(with Jeffrey Rogers Hummel), at

"""Andrew J. Clark III"" <clark97@swbell.net>",IRS Tax Determination Letter,"Wed, 13 Dec 2000 09:23:00 -0800 (PST)","Jim:

Thank you for your communication advising as to the concern that the IRS
seems to have about non-profits and the internet.  In early February of
this year I filed a form 1023 seeking a tax determination letter for
""Technology For All"" a Texas non-profit corporation whose mission it is
to enhance the educational and economic opportunities of the
disadvantaged (""TFA"").  TFA has a strong board led by Ken Lay, the CEO
of Enron Corporation.  TFA has assisted its affiliates (all believed to
be tax exempt non profits) in building computer learning centers
(""CLC's"") where recycled computers and donated software are connected
over the Enron Broadband Network (donated to TFA) to a server farm that
delivers to the disadvantaged at the CLC's educational and other
content.  There are over 75 CLC's in Houston, some 25 in Colorado and we
are building affiliations that will build them across the country and
eventually all over the world.  The business plan for this contemplates
operations in excess of one billion by the end of five years.  However,
we have not yet received our tax determination letter.  We have found
that major contributors require a tax determination letter.

    I received a response from the IRS on May 3, 2000.  On May 11, 2000,
I responded with answers to the inquiries made by the IRS.  Then on June
8 I was advised that our application had been sent to the national
office.  On November 15 I received another letter from the IRS raising
some additional questions unrelated to the first response.  While there
were some that were of substance in the main they were pretty weak.  The
first question was something like ""What did we mean by disadvantaged?""

    My question to you is what do you think is best to get this going
and out of the IRS?  Should I ask our board members to use their
considerable political influence tocause the IRS to move this?  Back in
August I had Bill Archer give the Commissioner an invitation to finish
this.  It did not seem to work.  I do not wish for an effort on my part
to cause this to go to the bottom of some bureaucrats stack.     Your
advice would be appreciated.

WewerLacy@aol.com,Re: IRS Tax Determination Letter,"Wed, 13 Dec 2000 12:34:00 -0800 (PST)","Jack:

    We routinely work with applications that have been ""sent to the national
office.""  If an application is ""sent to the national office,"" it means that
an issue or issues have been identified in the application by the original
reviewing agent that give the agent pause, and which the agent feels a more
technical review by a more skilled agent is required.  It always means that
there is some problem with the application that could result in denial of the
application.

    I suspect that what the IRS would really like your client to do is
establish objective standards in your organization's fundamental documents
for determining who is to receive the assistance of the charity.   Such
standards would give the IRS assurance that only poor people would receive
the benefits, and make it easier to determine if the mission was being
adhered to in an audit of activities.  Addressing this concern could be as
simple as enacting a Bylaw amendment or more likely an amendment to the
Articles of Incorporation.

    Last year, our office was brought in at the ""national office"" stage, well
after the Form 1024 was filed, to help a group of ranchers and cattlemen in
Wyoming/Montana opposed to illegal imports of below cost beef, to obtain
trade association status, (501(c)(6)), that the national office kept trying
to deny by saying they were an agriculture organization (which meant
potentially less availability of tax deductible contributions under o162).
What we did in that case was setup a conference call with the client's
lawyers and the IRS national office team assigned to the file.  We talked
through the application, identified each and every problem the IRS had
identified, and then our firm prepared, in essence, a supplemental brief
addressing each issue.  In the process, we learned that a few minor changes
to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, plus the supplemental
application information, were enough to address the IRS's agents concerns,
and they issued the tax determination letter.

    Thus, I would suggest that you request a conference call with the
national office agent or ""team"" reviewing the application, and get them to
identify each and every concern with the application.   Then, ask them for a
period of time to respond.  Ask them if changes in the fundamental corporate
documents would help address their concerns.  And of course, be mindful that
if you have had ongoing activities, you will want to be sure that anything
you do will result in retroactive deductibility for what contributions you
have already received.

    During late 1999, the IRS was accused of responding to political pressure
in triggering audits of exempt organizations by the Landmark Legal
Foundation, a conservative, Washington, D.C. legal foundation.  Landmark did
a Freedom of Information Act request and released documents which tended to
indicate that the IRS was auditing groups in response to complaints from
Congressmen.  The IRS denied that political influence plays a role in its
decisions, and, since then, the IRS exempt organizations unit has been very
careful about not creating an impression that they respond to political
pressure.

    If your client would like our firm to help as a consultant to work with
the national office, we'd be pleased to be of assistance.  We would need to
review the file and have your client execute a Form 2848 Power of Attorney
for us to join the team.

    Hope this is helpful.

Meeting"" on Friday May 18.  
Based on very positive responses, we expect participation from a number of 
commercial groups from within Enron -- including Enron Europe, EES, ENA, ETS, 
EGM and others.

The meeting will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. (including lunch) in room 
8C1, 8th floor of the Enron Building.  (Representatives of Enron Europe will 
participate in the morning session by video conference, and others from 
various locations will participate by telephone.)

The objectives of the session are to:

1) provide Enron commercial and support groups with the latest information on 
emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts worldwide, and

2) receive feedback on commercial interests and input on policy options so 
that we may develop the best business and policy strategies for Enron in both 
the short and long term.

We would like you to invite you to join the session for as long as your 
schedule permits, as well as make a few brief remarks about the importance of 
global emissions issues -- such as climate change and U.S. multipollutant 
legislation -- to the group.

We are still preparing a detailed agenda, but expect to cover a number of 
topics related to U.S. and international emissions issues.  A draft is 
attached.

I hope you will be able to join us for what should be a very insightful and 
productive session.

Rosalee:  please let me know of potentially-available times for Dr. Lay's 
participation at your earliest convenience.

Thank you,

	tee 7.16-19.01","Mon, 14 May 2001 09:36:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken,

Houston's bid for the 2012 Olympic Games is entering the final phase of the
domestic bid process.  This summer, the United States Olympic Committee
(USOC) will conduct initial site visits and evaluations of the eight U.S.
bid cities with the goal being to cut the number of cities to three or four.
This cut will occur in December of this year.  The USOC will be conducting
Houston's site visit July 16-19, 2001.

This site visit is critical to our ultimate success in bringing the Olympic
Games to Houston.  Over the four-day period in which the USOC site
evaluation team is in Houston, two days will be devoted to venue tours and
presentations.  There are eight presentation topics predetermined by the
USOC, one of which is International Strategy. Simply stated, this is where
we show why we think Houston can win on the international level.

As a Port Commissioner and a board member of Houston 2012, I will be part of
the team that presents this section to the USOC site evaluation team.  As
arguably the most identifiable international corporate leader in Houston and
as the Chairman of the 1990 Economic Summit and the 1992 Republican National
Convention, both of which you left with a positive surplus (very important
to the Olympics), you are in an excellent position to discuss Houston's
international status.

George DeMontrond, Susan Bandy (the Houston 2012 Exec Director) and I would
very much appreciate 15 minutes or so of your time to update you on
Houston's bid efforts and discuss your potential participation in the
upcoming site visit. You are our first and only choice, and I'd like the
opportunity to show you how important this is for Houston. We expect the
number of U.S. bid cities to be reduced to four finalists by this December
as a result of these meetings.  I will call Rosalee to schedule a time for a
visit at your offices. All the best and I look forward to catching up with
you soon. I'm attaching my bio, which details the last few years of activity
I've been involved with, most of which emanated from your support for me on
the UH Board of Regents, the 1990 Economic Summit Host Committee, the 1992
RNC Convention and later the GHP. Thank you for everything you've done for
Sarah and me -- hopefully I've reciprocated by doing a good job for you each
time.

Harry (or, again, should I address you as ""Houston's Sugar Daddy"" as  they

I am going to take about 1/2 of my  golf clubs to Europe on the coming trip.

Mick will probably take  his 5 iron. ?If you and Ken take your clubs then we 
could have fun,  exchange money, and get some exercise together. 

In this regard, since  you are the student of golf courses everywhere why 
don't you extract from  some of your library of golf books some suggested 
courses to play. If you  do not have this info in your library I will be glad 
to work on this.  

Also, and the real point of this e-mail, I want to ask you to  do something 
for all of us. I need to know the exact names of the courses  we have played 
on previous trips. I know you saved ball markers etc  from each course and my 
old brain does not remember these course names. As  you well know, I normally 
""tear up"" score cards after each match.  ??I ask you to do this for a reason. 
? 
I have a little gift  for each golfer that will serve as a record of courses 
played by us, but I  need the names of the past ones played. ?There is no 
rush 
on this  request. ?If you will do this, simply bring the list to the 
airplane:  
you can give this info to me after take off on May 29th. ?If you do  not have 
this info at your ""finger tips,"" so be it, we will simply ""wing  it."" 

Hope all is well with you and Macey. ?Brenda and I will see  you guys at the

"""Beau Herrold"" <beau@layfam.com>",Update,"Wed, 16 Aug 2000 09:31:00 -0700 (PDT)","Per our meeting today, I spoke with Sherrie about  lines of credit at 
(PaineWebber) PW.? We have about another $5 million  available with a little 
bit of cushion.? I also spoke with Rocky about how  they arrive at their loan 
to value calculations and he is going to have me talk  with the person in 
that department to walk me through it.? Regardless of  how much that number 
moves, I told Sherrie that you would like to know where it  stands at the 
time she provides the information for all of the other  lines.? I told her 
that we should have that updated once a  week.
?
I also?thought it would be good?within  the?partnership to borrow against the 
PW accounts, which include Fayez,  Cypress, Eagle, and Harris Bretall for 
some of these private investments.?  The combined gross value is at $2.5 
million so that would allow for an  additional $1.25 million to be borrowed 
at 50% loan to value.? It may be a  higher number, but with a small cushion 
that is probably a good estimate.?  I talked to Rocky about this and he said 
it would be no problem and he would  give us the same rate 70 basis points.
?
With regards to rates and the PW/UBS merger, Rocky  said that he thinks that 
he can get our borrowing rate down from 70 basis points  plus LIBOR to 20 
basis points plus LIBOR come this November when the merger is  completed.
?
I have Rocky working on much better reports, like  that which was provided to 
be by Mueller/O'Shaughnessy at MSDW.? I told him  that they needed to work on 
what they have?been providing to me.? I  have not been impressed with the 
last couple of reports he has produced so that  is why you haven't seen 
them.? Rocky informed me that?he has sense  gone out and purchased a better 
system for that purpose.
?
I also told him that I would like an update on the  performance reports that 
are run on managers, specifically ours.?  Also,?I am having him include 
managers that invest in Latin America.?  I though it would be good, since 
Robert Day of TCW has been positive about  that?geographic area.
?
With regards to any future selling of personal  Enron stock, Rocky recommends 
selling within your?retirment plan since the  taxes are deferred and 
diversify within it.? Maybe set-up some of the  managed accounts here.? I 
inquired about the Enron 401(k) plan?with  regards to any additional choices 
to be offered.? He said that he?was  in talks with the people at Enron who 
handle it, but nothing would probably  happen anytime soon.? I don't know if 
that meant he was implying a need for  a push from?Enron's upper management?
to  make it happen.
?
I know that Sherrie is working her tail off to try  and get you the July 
Financials before your trip.? I know she is planning  on staying late to get 
it completed.? I told her that you want them before  you depart on your trip 
tomorrow.
?
I think that that is all for now.

Nice to see you again this morning in the lobby.  It's always a pleasure to 
enjoy your courtesy.  

Three years ago, you helped me get into Enron.  I am still immensely 
grateful.  It has been a fabulous experience.  Now, Azurix is releasing me;  
my last day is 31 DEC 2000.  I'm looking for a new position at Enron.  
Barring that, I take a standard severance package on 01 JAN 2001 and go 
overboard.  I'm taking the typical aggressive Enron approach to networking, 
so if you are aware of something, I'd appreciate knowing.  I'll be over to

I've continued to hone my skills, and provide leadership and creativity in 
difficult circumstances.  
I know Enron is changing.  I'm willing to change (and learn!) with it.  
There's a lot I can do for Enron.  I'd just like to have a shot at it.

give formal notice that they will be ceasing service from Portland to Narita
and Nagoya Japan, as well as several other US cities as of April 1, 2001.
They will have 15 flights a day to 5 cities, down from 24 flights a day to
12 cities.  Included in the cut list are flights to San Francisco, Las
Vegas, Los Angeles, and New York.  Following is the statement I am releasing
to the media today about my disappointment about the situation this leaves
us in and my plans to look for alternate carriers.

""I am very disappointed by today's announcement.  This is a big loss for
Portland, and it will have a lasting effect on our economy.

""Perhaps because of the current strong economy, Portlanders have
consistently rated efforts to 'grow as an international city' lowest on
their list of priorities.  Still, as Mayor I worked long and hard with Delta
over the last ten years and fought for their routes to Osaka and Fukuoka,
because I felt strongly that Portland's future was in being an international
city.  Portland will not continue to thrive if we accept doing business only
within the confines of our city limits.  With the high tech economy of today
and the reach of the internet, we must reach across borders.

""That's why I've led efforts to create business strategies --
Internationalizing Greater Portland I & II -- which focused on air and trade
connections because our business partners are no longer just on the other
side of town, or even the other side of the state.  We are competing in
markets around the world, and with Delta's decision we are losing an
important link to our partners and friends in Asia.  We also stand to lose
connections to major cities right here in the U.S.

""While I understand the economics of this decision -- the unexpected
downturn in the Asian economy, the continuing problems with the INS --  I
have learned something from our Asian partners over the years and that is
the importance of investing in relationships.

""Next week we will open the finest classical Chinese garden outside of
China.  Our goal is to create an atmosphere in Portland where people from
other countries feel comfortable doing business with us because we honor
their culture.

""This sets us back nearly 15 years -- 15 years of promoting Portland to
Asian cities from Sapporo to Seoul.  My mission now is to work hard to
ensure it doesn't take us that long to recover.

""I will be working with our partners in the business community, the Port,
our congressional delegation, and the Governor's office to look at
alternative providers for Asian service. We may have opportunities because
of the state of flux in the airlines industry.  I will also be asking for
more local support for our international efforts.  I have met with
representatives from other cities, and have been looking at the Seattle and
Amsterdam models of promoting their cities internationally.

""Further, I will also be pushing Delta to re-examine its New York route.
This is the 12th largest flight out of PDX, carrying 200,000 people
annually.  It's a route critical to our major retailers and financial
institutions.""","[('I', 12), ('cities', 7), ('Portland', 7)]"
"""Watson, John"" <jwatson@velaw.com>",FW: SFLP Spreadsheet,"Thu, 7 Sep 2000 02:49:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken-Here is a first cut at a spread sheet for the distributions necessary to
return at lease $100,000 to everyone so no partner will have to put up any
new money.  Have you heard from Texaco or BFI? Also, Marathon committed to
the roll over, but not the referendum.  You may need to make a call to
Marathon to see if you can convince them on the referendum.  Conoco also
only committed to their proportionate part, probably about $50,000, for the
referendum and Don Sanders said he would commit $50,000 toward the
referendum.  We, therefore could have only $1 million from the partners on
the referendum if Marathon, Texaco and BFI don't contribute.  We do have
$100,000, however, from Reliant.  Moreover, without Sanders, BFI and
possibly Texaco, we may have only around $30 million to rollover into the
loan.  As soon as we can the final answers from all of the partners we will
be able to finalize the term sheet with the Sports Authority and get the
advance payment on the loan.  I still haven't heard from Goldberg on the

Cindy,
Thank you for your interest in Enron Omaha community relations initiatives. 
As you are aware, our budget is jointly managed and coordinated with Northern 
Plains. Attached for your review is a list of Enron Omaha funded health and 
human care programs serving children, teenagers, adults, families and the 
elderly. Each of these commitments have been reviewed by our employee 
activity committee and receives their full support. In fact, the 
philanthropic strategy to self-direct 50% of our corporate United Way match, 
has given our employee's a greater sense of ownership in our contribution 
decisions.


In addition, Enron Omaha has replicated the successful Houston based 
signature programs, Community 101 and PowerBlast. Our employee's also enjoy 
four Big ""E"" cafe's during the year, with the event proceeds donated to a 
United Way agency. 

Finally, your additional gift to allow Enron Omaha to actively participate in 
constructing a new city Arena and Convention center was sincerely 
appreciated. The convention center project  is the largest community 
improvement effort in the state.
Thank you for all your personal support and that of your professional staff.

Video on the Move
Dropping costs and rising competition are forcing operators to see
video-on-demand in a whole new light
BY SIMON APPLEBAUM
At VOD programmer Diva, the deployment forecast gets more specific, as does
the rationale behind why operators will push the action. Three factors come
into play:
* DBS penetration continues to fly and bite off operators' best customers;
* the plunging expense of video-server hardware and video-stream
transmissions, which make moot the big, prohibitive load operators have used
to justify not deploying VOD;
* the fallout from Time Warner's deal to merge with America Online --
namely, considerable encouragement to accelerate plans in every other
convergence direction they want to travel, be it digital cable services
(including near-VOD and tiers), high-speed Web surfing through cable modems,
or interactive TV.
Thus with cost and infrastructure concerns put aside, and competition
staring them in the face, operators see VOD in a new light. Now that DBS
reaches 13 million subs ""and is heading for 20 million, cable is feeling the
pain,"" says Diva president David Zucker. ""Every one of the eight largest
cable operators, every single one, will deploy or trial VOD in some manner.
The big rollouts will start the second half of the year."" If they come, they
may hear another set of competitive footsteps entering the scene. Digital
subscriber line carriers such as SBC and Qwest, hunting for high-speed
Internet households, are poised to reach out and become must-see VOD TV
through Viacom subsidiary Blockbuster. With infrastructure help from Enron
Broadband Services, Blockbuster will deploy a movies-driven VOD service in a
number of cities by December, and all over the U.S. next year. The joint
venture will go after cable and DBS distribution, but off the bat, DSL will
be in the driver's seat, as routed through SBC, Qwest and other suppliers.
But right now, reality is nowhere near the perception Jacobsen and Zucker
suggest. Few multi-system owners have VOD formats fully deployed or in
trial; most MSOs don't, even though they are deep in digital-service
launches incorporating near-VOD, which takes up 30 channels or more of a
system's lineup. Video-on-demand, on the other hand, uses far fewer channels
than NVOD, because video servers, placed at or near the system's headend,
store the programming and transmit it on addressable command from
subscribers, any time, over streaming transmissions. How high is the payoff
for mass cable adoption? Try 40 to 60 percent, by 2010, of the multi-billion
dollar revenue pot home-video companies enjoy now, predicted Merrill Lynch
senior media analyst Jessica Reif-Cohen at the recent Myers interactive-TV
forum in New York.
Where the Action Is
You need more than one hand to count the number of VOD projects happening
around the country, but you don't need many more. Here's the scorecard:
 * Diva - VOD's veteran packager is doing full-deployment business in at
least 10 areas. Affiliates include AT&T Broadband in Marin County, Calif.
(outside San Francisco) and Atlanta (formerly MediaOne turf); Charter
Communications in the Atlanta suburbs; and a growing number of Insight
Communications locales (Columbus, Ohio; Rockford, Ill.; and Evansville,
Ind.) where VOD is bundled with Source Media's Local Source interactive-TV
service. Before Labor Day, Charter will add Diva to at least one of its Los
Angeles-area systems. More than 400 titles, from movie blockbusters to
special-interest videos, are available each month. Top films go for $3.95 a
pop, while classic flicks and other titles get priced at $2.95 or below.
Available attractions include library shows from ESPN, TNT, Discovery and
other cable nets. About 15,000 subs use the service at least once a month.
 * Time Warner - Cable's second-largest operator is in full VOD blast,
following a trial run in Austin, Texas, last summer. Honolulu became the
first Time Warner locale to make VOD available system-wide earlier this
year, covering about 250,000 subs. Tampa, Fla., turned on in June, according
to Concurrent Computer, which provides servers and streaming tech to Time
Warner. About 100,000 Tampa-area subs are getting their day in the VOD sun.
* Intertainer - After two years of development and tests, the VOD player
that includes Microsoft, Comcast, NBC, Sony and Intel among its equity
stakeholders will soon premiere in Comcast's suburban Baltimore system. That
follows DSL rollouts in U S West's Denver enterprise and Cincinnati under an
independent franchiser. The service has plenty of interactive features to
accompany the content, including opportunities to order an artist's CD after
watching his music video; local information retrieval; and e-commerce
choices. Intertainer CEO Jonathan Taplin promises a ""stunning""
MSO-affiliation announcement over the next few weeks.
* In Demand - PPV's kingpin player was already talking to affiliates about
VOD rollouts and trials when new president Stephen Brenner assumed his post
earlier this summer (see sidebar, p. 30).
* TVN - In Demand's closest PPV/NVOD rival, whose affiliate base consists of
mid-size and small system owners, is in the midst of several VOD technical
and marketing trials. Some rollout announcements are expected early this
fall. Like Diva and Intertainer, TVN wants to combine programming with
interactive applications.
 * DemandVideo - This California-based firm surfaced this spring, initially
on a quest for cable overbuilder affiliates so that they wouldn't be absent
from VOD activity. Seren Innovations (which runs its systems under Astound
Cable TV) and Knology signed up before the National Cable TV Association
convention, and Seren put Demand's format through a 25-home trial in St.
Cloud, Minn. But at NCTA's show in May, Demand CEO Rajiv Juluria insisted
that his product will be available to all comers, entrenched or encroacher.
Knology will launch the service among hotels in Panama City, Fla., while
Seren commits to a full St. Cloud rollout, plus deployment in Contra Costa
County, Calif.
* E-Video TV - A new VOD player out of Scottsdale, Ariz., E-Video has
developed download technology through which digital cable subs can retrieve
feature films, programming and interactive games. Roy Bennett, E-Video's
president, says his firm will try the process out with a cable operator
before summer ends.
Up ahead in the player pipeline: StreamBox and AlwaysonTV.com, two ventures
running both video and Internet content. Both exhibited two months ago at
Streaming Media East in New York. Within VOD's own tech vendordom --
companies that provide video servers and program-insertion gear to operators
-- there's growing consensus that the on-demand era launches this fall. How
fast VOD takes off is more in the hands of set-top box providers than MSOs,
believes Concurrent CEO Steve Nussrallah. The sooner they flood the scene
with digital converters, the sooner deployments happen.  ""We're at the front
door of an explosion. Late fall or early next year is the right time for
this market to happen,"" he says. ""The only thing holding the market back is
the ability of set-top vendors to build and ship their product at a level
equal to the demand. By the end of 2004, we should be north of 30 million
digital set-tops, with the vast majority of them VOD-enabled. Deployment by
operators becomes a no-brainer."" AOL Time Warner will push operators into
deployment decisions, adds nCube president Michael Pohl. ""The convergence of
Time Warner's content with the broadband opportunities AOL looks at will
drive the content and availability of content for VOD,"" Pohl suggests.
""Movies are OK and great, probably a good place to start, but ultimately,
viewers want to go to their operator and ask for whatever they want to see.""
""You see the operators showing excitement for VOD now, as opposed to the
vendors showing excitement, which is what it was for the last few years,""
says Yvette Gordon, interactive technologies VP at SeaChange Technologies.
""The AOL-Time Warner merger helps.""
The Naysayers
But many people don't buy it. Take Playboy Television -- they're supplying
product to selected Diva and Time Warner VOD markets. They're in the game,
but Playboy TV president Jim English doesn't look for a breakout market
until 2002. Why? Despite big declines in server cost, ""you need so many per
state, so many per [sub universe],"" English reasons. ""The more subs on the
line, the slower the traffic goes. It's still very expensive electronics.
I'm not trying to poke holes at anyone, but a lot of projections about this
industry didn't come out as advertised. How many years did it take for
digital cable to move? Even now, operators have more trucks dedicated to
installing high-speed cable modems than digital cable. And on cable's agenda
priority scale, just getting the digital box in is number one."" For
Susquehanna Communications and Classic Cable, 2001 is the year VOD will make
it to their systems, provided the tech issues English raises get resolved.
As big as the case is for getting economics down enough for deployment among
large MSOs, it's magnified several times over for owners the size of
Susquehanna and Classic.  ""Insight, for example, can serve tens or hundreds
of thousands of customers from a single headend. The best we can do is 7,000
customers from a single headend. For the small, non-metro markets we
service, how do you amortize the cost for initial equipment installation?""
asks Classic CEO Merritt Belisle. ""When you take into account the
flexibility and long-term viability of the tech, and different content
avenues, there's a lot that's nascent and in development,"" responds Dan
Templain, Susquehanna's corporate marketing/programming director. ""The
content and the tech have to become compelling enough to consumers that
we're willing to roll it out."" Still, Templain's company is determined to do
a field trial somewhere this fall, and get deployment underway before the
end of next March. ""That's accelerated thinking from where we were six
months ago."" To SVOD or Not to SVOD? On the programming side, the train
everyone wants to be aboard is making VOD a diverse medium, perhaps to the
point where the medium should be relabeled ""COD"" -- for content-on-demand.
Movies, available at or earlier than home-video release, lead the way, but
not far behind are sports, live/taped events from all over, how-to and
special-interest videos, children's fare, games, adult entertainment and a
few genres spun out of the imagination of others.  ""There may be
localized-content opportunities,"" chirps In Demand's Jacobsen. ""Local
theater, high school football games with real community value."" In a COD
world, ""you're not limited to video product,"" says TVN senior business
development VP Jim Riley. ""Eventually, you download computer software so you
can view it on your TV as well as on your PC. That's where we're driving
some of our development energies."" TVN's vehicle is Chromazone, involving
California-based venture capitalist Digital Evolution. From the start,
Intertainer has embraced a link of COD with interactive elements. ""If MSOs
make the investment in VOD, they must maximize it with advertising,
e-commerce and all sorts of interactivity,"" says Jonathan Taplan,
Intertainer's president and CEO. ""That's the ultimate promise. If you think
about the capital investment and the possible return in gross revenues, like
$20 a sub per month, that's a damn good business."" Diva, infused with $9
million earlier this summer from operating system/middleware players OpenTV
and Liberate Technologies (CV, 7/17/00, p. 98), now has economic backing to
pursue its own interactive-integration course. And soon, cable operators
will see if their VOD future should incorporate subscription
video-on-demand, or SVOD. Encore Media Group, under CEO John Sie, is betting
a substantial chunk of its future on it, and in a matter of weeks, AT&T
Broadband's newly acquired Atlanta system (off the completed MediaOne
merger) will test SVOD out using Encore, Starz! and Encore's multiplex
movies. Here's the SVOD deal, as Sie explains it: Premium service subs, for
an extra fee, get 20-30 titles running on that service that month on-demand,
with VCR functionality. The subs watch those films whenever they want, as
many times as they want, for that one fee. Six or eight dollars a month will
do. ""We're using VOD as a viewer enhancement platform,"" Sie insists. ""Movies
will drive things first. Once they drive penetration, you can do
subscription news-on-demand and other things on-demand."" Lately, Sie's SVOD
advocacy comes framed inside a clarion call to move operators in the
direction of all-digital system conversion. Direct broadcast satellite
services are that way now, and Sie believes cable system owners have two
years at most to make that transition, contrary to the seven-to-10-year
timeframe other industry execs predict. ""You know and I know consumer demand
for digital far exceeds set-top box availability, as well as the supply of
installation crews. DBS realized that and now they're ramping up,"" Sie
believes. But opponents find two flaws in SVOD: Because the product is
available in the premium window, six months or more after PPV availability,
there may not be as much audience demand for it compared to pre-PPV.
Independent of audience demand, there's the specter of cannibalization,
where on-demand use comes at the expense of premium-channel viewing. ""Here's
a way to enhance and optimize premium services,"" Nussrallah concludes. ""If
you get constant access to the programming, it's more customer-friendly, and
something DBS can't provide. Cable is built on the concept that the audience
buys more if they have more choice and convenience. It may be the next
opportunity window."" Not so, Taplin figures. ""It would be cool to get all of
The Sopranos on a VOD package. But why would people who already see movies
on premium pay for more of those same movies, after they've had the chance
to watch those movies in an on-demand way. Unless Sie prices it so low, or
unless they like those movies a lot, why would they pay again? The flat-fee
model is a great model, like cellular-phone pricing. People love paying one
fee for unlimited monthly use. But the window isn't the right window."" Sie
defends SVOD as an enhancement option. ""Would an operator launch digital
cable with pay TV only and not launch PPV, concluding that PPV cannibalizes
pay, or vice versa? No, because they complement each other beautifully. Same
here."" Other VOD programmers and tech vendors will pursue SVOD experiments.
TVN is investigating one or more affiliate partnerships for a test. Classic
and Susquehanna are open to proposals. ""What John says is super. What does
it cost me? I've got a stock market and bond market to work with,"" Belisle
says.
Stream Thinking
Susquehanna exec Templain calls SVOD ""a work in progress platform."" Others
say the same about streamed video content, another pot worthy of industry
exploitation. ""Spectacular"" may be the most accurate adjective for the
assortment of video Internet sites have streamed to PC households
everywhere, from quirky animation to short films to news clips. More
diverse, longer streamed content is coming down the pike. Will the very same
tech making mass VOD deployment possible now also make possible a new
original content pipe? What an ironic circumstance. Check in with the sites
themselves, from Real Networks on down, and the masterminds behind them
point to TV and cable display as their final destination. Fifty million PCs,
more than 100 million TV homes, almost 70 percent of them cabled -- the
market's obvious to them. In the end, that's the ticket, cable execs concur.
But for the near term, no. The broadcast quality's not there yet (although
tech strides are happening), and there's considerable fear that producers
will use streaming to bypass cable nets. Gordon targets mid to late 2001 as
the point where streamed content will be TV/VOD-suitable. Assuming the
industry locks its fears away, nCube's Pohl sides with the crowd awaiting
""this kind of ubiquitous media, where things go to the TV or PC."" ""We're
sleeping fine at night about this, because the quality is not there yet,""
adds Diva's Zucker. ""But we will make video streaming a Holy Grail for TV in
the next few years, and cable will be uniquely positioned to take advantage
of it."" *

Jeffrey Sherrick,Janus,"Thu, 7 Sep 2000 10:17:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken/Joe,  As I was walking back to my office reflecting on our conversation, 
there are three points that I mentioned but I think got lost in the 
discussion.

1)  This needs to be a stock deal to avoid Indian tax (48%), poorly written 
preferential purchase language and gov't approval.  (Still requires RBI 
approval)  All of the numbers I have in the document assume a stock 
transaction. 

2) RIL is very tax advantaged, currently and for the foreseeable future they 
will be in an NOL position;  therefore, at the numbers we are discussing they 
should see this as an unleveraged return opportunity of 16% (stock purchase 
fully taxed with no basis) to 27% (stock purchase shielded from taxes-- Btax 
scenario).   Again, the tax position makes RIL unique for this transaction 
and a very likely buyer at these numbers.  Few other parties will be as 
positioned to consider a stock transaction of a company with minimal Indian 
basis, accept the operational conditions and be able to close as quickly.  

 3) The idea of coupling the other India assets with the E&P is a good 
strategy if your goal is to ultimately sale, but time is unimportant.   I've 
done multi-asset deals before with a major and the bureaucracy rivals India.  
The due diligence on the multiple assets will eliminate any chance of closing 
this year. In fact, I would be surprised if we could even get a PSA signed 
before year-end on a multi-asset deal, plus the gov't approvals become more 
complex.  

 If the goal is money in the door before 12/31/00,  I favor a buy/sell at 
Ken's number.  If we go to October and don't get the documents in place we 
really haven't lost anything because there is little likelihood of closing 
under a traditional scenario even if we start today.   We will prepare our 
dataroom while the negotiations on the documents take place and be ready to 
bring in bidders by October. If we buy at these numbers I believe we can flip 
the deal within 6-9 months if not sooner since we have operatorship, critical 
mass a major would covet, only one partner and Reliance is not a partner.  

Also,  If we elect to go to a traditional auction, I would strongly suggest 
we keep the E&P separate from the other India assets, at least initially, to 
run the auction with the best chance of getting a PSA signed before 
year-end.   We can always combine them at a later date during negotiations 
once we see how the process is going.  Too many pieces right out of the box 
will be very cumbersome and time consuming.  If we have to combine them to 
get interest, we can do it as we see the need for an enhancement.
 

My final thought, if we do an outright sale to RIL ( not a pre-negotiated 
buy/sell with stipulated closing dates,,, etc.) they will want to do a 
certain amount of due diligence and rightfully so.   They would expect and 
probably demand the same considerations as any other buyer including a 
dataroom visit to pick our brains one more time.  Again this becomes a time 
issue!!  Under the buy/sell scenario we have devised, there is no due 
diligence period, the structure of the deal is stipulated and everything is 
handled via representations and warranties in the pre-negotiated PSA.     


Let me know how and when you wish to proceed.   I will pursue with complete 
dedication whichever option you select.

Thanks for the time to share my thoughts,
jeff","[('I', 10), ('If', 5), ('time', 5)]"

Dear Dean Walker -

Ken Lay asked me to respond to you re:

1) Naming the new professorship the Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching
Professorship - this is fine.
2) He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on
October 13.

Thanks.

Jeffrey Sherrick,Project Janus,"Fri, 8 Sep 2000 09:44:00 -0700 (PDT)","Ken,  I thought it would be better if I typed my thoughts for you since my 
hand writing can be somewhat difficult to read. 

Before you decide the methodology for moving our project beyond the D. Ambani 
phone call, I would like to share a few thoughts that I believe reduces the 
risk of Enron being an E&P buyer.  I know the implications of making a large 
E&P purchase are far greater than just the cash requirement, but I believe 
with the following changes to the plan presented yesterday and a little 3rd 
party information, you may feel more comfortable making this decision.  Under 
the buy/sell arrangement a small risk of buying will always be present, but I 
believe the risk reward ratio in this case has very strong merit.  My goals 
for Enron are three fold; a) sale the assets, b) get cash in the door before 
year-end, and c) get fair value for the assets given the current situation.  
My comments touch upon five topics:

1)  Reverse the buy/sell process giving Enron the control vote
2)  Pay the Penalty
3) Contact someone at the Janus Fund to talk about Reliance's Financial 
condition
4) Thoughts on non-Reliance bidder's
5) Information and the future process

Reverse the Buy/Sell Process:   The plan outlined yesterday using the 
buy/sell scenario is the best scenario for achieving all of our goals.  The 
risk for Enron which is most troubling is the possibility of being a buyer 
versus a desire to be a seller.  I firmly believe if we make one change to 
the plan as described below, we can increase our probability of a successful 
sale to near 100%.  If we don't use a but/sell arrangement I am concerned 
that we will not get fair value or cash in the door this year.   In fact, I 
suspect we will elect not to sell because of contract or valuation problems, 
which in effect leave us with a stranded asset and a lot of employee 
problems.   

When you talk with Dhirubhai we can propose the buy/sell concept  with RIL 
making the first bid to purchase.  Enron then has the right to sell at that 
price or increase the bid by 5% and RiL must sell.  Since we are now in the 
control position the 10% tax logic we talked about yesterday no longer is 
valid, so I would describe the 5% as a control premium.  The only reason we 
want the buy option is in the event they offer a very low number.  I would 
suspect them to bid in the $550 to $650 million range.  They just turned down 
my offer to purchase their assets at $450mm and indicated we were 
substantially below their value when I tried to engage them in a dialogue.  
They know Enron paid $620 million just 12 months ago for the same position.  
We know they internally have reserves booked higher than ours and have a 
strong desire to have a substantial upstream position that they can control.  
It is possible that RIL would bid less than $500 million but I put that 
probability at less than one percent.  This reduces Enron's risk dramatically 
and increases our probability of getting all of our objectives met. We also 
get an added benefit, from pitching the deal with RIL as the first bidder,  
because this will  strengthen the perception that we (Enron) want to be the 
buyer, which is a key perception to have a fair auction with only one 
legitimate buyer, Reliance.  

If we  pitch the deal as suggested above,  we need to recognise going in that 
they probably want the control position as well.  I believe they would pay a 
very large value for these assets due to their tax position and by bidding 
first they take great risk of leaving a lot of money on the table or not 
getting the deal at all.   I would suspect that they will at a minimum 
suggest we flip a coin to see who bids first.  Initially I would just say no, 
but we may need to deal with this issue and probably should decide early on 
if it is a deal killer.  If we did flip a coin, we would wait until the 
documents were final and the escrow agreement was signed so there would be no 
backing out without a penalty.  In this scenario it would actually help get a 
more impartial document done quicker if neither party knew the bidding 
sequence until after the drafting was finalized.

Pay the Penalty: While it is not the way we want to do business, the worst 
case scenario under the proposed escrow agreement is to forfeit  $25 million 
if we elected not to follow through in an Enron  buy scenario.   Considering 
the upside to the buy/sell under either sequence (Enron first or RIL first) 
it may be worth the risk of losing the escrow under a black Friday scenario.  
I want to think about this over the weekend, but while I was thinking this 
afternoon the risk reward seems to be very favorable.  

Contact someone at Janus Fund:  This was suggested yesterday and I would 
strongly urge you to do this if you feel comfortable making the inquiry.  
Janus bought approximately a  5% position in RIL about 1-2 months ago.  I 
think you will get a very positive report on both the cash front and their 
desire to make the upstream a key part of the company.

Thoughts on Non- Reliance Bidders:  I have spent a lot more time thinking 
about this issue.   I can talk you through the reasons, but as long as 
Reliance is involved and a western company can only purchase a 30% 
non-operated working interest, we will have to take a huge discount to fair 
value.  I will be very surprised if we could get $450 million.  Again, going 
to the Shell's, BG's,,,etc  early on in the process,  I believe, is a huge 
mistake, both internally and externally.

Information Flow and Process:  Ken this is a very sensitive area but I feel 
compelled to mention this to you.  I am concerned about too many people 
knowing our plan and strategy and possibly others wanting to branch out with 
the intentions of helping, but actually causing problems.  This needs to be 
managed by one person, not three or four.  To meet all of our objectives this 
has to be an orchestrated deal from a to z.  I think you know more about my 
background then most others in Enron.  I worked the E&P M&A business for 10 
years and did pretty well at it.  I know the oil business and I believe that 
is a key to getting a good deal done.  I know these assets and all of the 
complex issues surrounding the assets, our subsidiaries, tax issues and the 
book considerations.  I'm the best person to get this deal done once you 
decide the risk the company is willing to take.  I know the limits of my 
authority and I will work within those bounds and keep the OOC completely and 
totally informed so proper decisions can be made when necessary. 

Ken, I promise you I will use others in the company where and when 
appropriate.  If I need help in India, I would not hesitate to ask Sanjay for 
such.  However, the last thing we can afford is excess discussion in India on 
this deal.  If Dhirubhai agrees to the deal, we need to get a meeting set in 
Europe at a neutral site to start the process.  My main objective is to  have 
a successful deal.  

I have decided not to go to India so we can concentrate on moving this 
forward.  Also, I will need your guidance on the future of the E&P plans for 
Enron when we decide the direction we plan to take on Panna, Mukta and 
Tapti.  I have looked at the key people necessary to make this happen and can 
talk to you about that as well if you so desire.

Thanks

Cynthia Sandherr,New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language,"Fri, 8 Sep 2000 09:49:00 -0700 (PDT)","Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. ""A"" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a ""must pass"" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is ""at least 
three years away from happening.""

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.
