Abstract of this news is:

************************

Ex-clients of former JPMorgan Chase broker Johnny Burris deny having any complaint with him after he was fired for whistle-blowing about internal pressure to sell bank's own mutual funds; grievances lodged were written by his employer, not clients, but complaints made it difficult for him to find new employment and contributed to failure of his case against JPMorgan for wrongful termination.
